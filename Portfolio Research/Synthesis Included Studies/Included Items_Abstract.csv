Conventional student feedback surveys, although commonly used, frequently suffer from bias, variability, and manual inefficiencies. This research introduces a machine learning framework aimed at automating and improving lecturer performance evaluation by utilizing both quantitative survey information and qualitative student insights. The framework integrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering to ready student evaluation data for predictive modeling. A range of machine learning methods, such as regression models, decision trees, ensemble techniques, and neural networks, are evaluated to determine the most efficient strategy. Furthermore, natural language processing (NLP) methods are employed to analyze open-ended feedback, drawing out valuable information that enhances numerical ratings. Experimental findings illustrate that the suggested approach successfully forecasts lecturer performance while mitigating biases and inconsistencies that characterize traditional assessments. Clustering techniques organize courses according to student feedback, sentiment analysis quantifies qualitative feedback, and topic classification highlights subject-specific patterns. The system delivers a scalable, unbiased, and automated solution for ongoing faculty evaluation, providing actionable insights for institutional decision-making. This research advances the development of technology-based educational assessment, facilitating more precise and data-informed lecturer evaluations.","2025-05-24","2026-03-01 03:48:45","2026-03-01 05:40:49","2026-03-01 03:48:45","291-296","","","","","","Enhancing Lecturer Performance Insights","","","","","IEEE","Penang, Malaysia","","https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2025 IEEE 15th Symposium on Computer Applications &amp; Industrial Electronics (ISCAIE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design and implementation of a web-based platform for the automation of the evaluation of research performance from publicly accessible Google Scholar metrics are presented in this paper. The system responds to the requirement of effective data collection and analysis by pulling out citation-based metrics like total citations, h-index, and i10-index from faculty profiles. These are then classified into quartile levels (Q1-Q4) in relation to journal quality, enabling institutions to assess departmental research productivity in an organized and comparative way. The architecture of the platform combines web scraping methodologies for data harvesting, Python for data processing, and React.js for frontend interaction. Data is displayed through interactive dashboards that present department-wise averages and allow users to drill down into faculty-specific contributions within a quartile. The solution further includes fall-back mechanisms to deal with missing or inconsistent information and uses optimized scraping frequencies to adhere to web access restrictions. The system suggested offers an institutional research analysis with a scalable and visually appealing method. Translating disjointed citation data into actionable visual understandings, the platform allows academic administrators to track research trends, discover high-performing departments, and aid accreditation or strategic planning purposes. The combination of automation and visualization dramatically decreases man hours, increases transparency, and facilitates informed academic governance.","2025-12-12","2026-03-01 03:48:46","2026-03-01 05:40:13","2026-03-01 03:48:46","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Pune, India","","https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2025 IEEE Pune Section International Conference (PuneCon)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This includes faculty ranking and evaluation. In this study, the development of a web and mobile application for automating the process of re-ranking faculty members of National University in the Philippines is focused. The purpose of the study is to address the inefficiency and accuracy of the current manual re-ranking process. The mentioned manual process is time-consuming and riddled with errors due to file duplication and unruly storage systems. Previous studies pointed out the use of technology in the educational industry but did not provide enough evidence how the faculty re-ranking process can be automated. This research, therefore, will fill this gap that can ease and secure faculty credential management by creating a system. This will enhance decision-making via data analytics and can improve workflow efficiency in the Faculty Service Office. There will be two methodologies that will be used for this study: Descriptive and Agile. This will be used together to identify the current challenges using interviews and surveys. This will be followed by an Agile Kanban Framework application in the development of the application. The findings indicate that the proposed system significantly reduces processing time, minimizes errors, and provides insights through data analytics to ensure a more effective and efficient way of faculty management. It shows that any educational institution will perform better if it automates its administrative process for proper utilization of its resources.","2025-04-26","2026-03-01 03:48:47","2026-03-01 05:39:03","2026-03-01 03:48:47","221-225","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Tokyo, Japan","","https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2025 16th International Conference on E-Education, E-Business, E-Management and E-Learning (IC4e)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, conventional evaluation methods are error-prone, erroneous, and subjective. This paper proposes an integrated web-based Faculty Appraisal System developed on the LAMP stack, with Python-powered analytics and visualization, thus enabling a role-based dashboard for students, faculty, HODs, HRM in-charges, principals, IQAC, and HR/COE, allowing multi-tier verification. The faculties submit their self-appraisal in academic mentorship (40%), research development (40%), and contribution activities (20%), and the students give structured feedback. This system adopts AHP to deduce weighted evaluation criteria in a structured method, thus ensuring consistent and structured scoring. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) ranks faculty by comparing performances with ideal marks and hence guarantees fairness and objectivity. The proposed models have been integrated with Random Forest algorithms so as to enhance predictive accuracy and analyze historical data for classification, clustering, and performance prediction. EDA has been embedded to automate data cleaning, outlier detection, and visualization through bar and pie charts so that the reliability and transparency of data increase. An automated scoring engine assists growth-oriented decisions and incentive distribution, reduces bias, and enables real-time institutional analytics and adaptive policy refinement. Experimental deployment of the proposed system verifies its robustness in fostering a consistent data-driven process for faculty appraisals, which also points toward a roadmap for institutional excellence.","2025-11-24","2026-03-01 03:48:48","2026-03-01 05:39:42","2026-03-01 03:48:48","655-661","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Coimbatore, India","","https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2025 5th International Conference on Evolutionary Computing and Mobile Sustainable Networks (ICECMSN)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

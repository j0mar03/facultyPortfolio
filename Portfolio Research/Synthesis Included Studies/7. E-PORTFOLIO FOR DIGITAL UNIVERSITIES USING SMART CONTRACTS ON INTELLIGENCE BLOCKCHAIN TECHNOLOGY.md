## 5) Participants and Data

- Unit of analysis: Model components (appropriateness of input, process, results, and feedback).
- Sample size (n): 9
- Participant profile: Experts in information technology, educational information and communications, and artificial intelligence with at least five years of relevant experience.
- Data sources:
    - `survey` (Expert evaluation assessment forms).
- Inclusion/exclusion (if reported): Included experts with specific IT/AI/Educational communications expertise and a minimum of five years of experience.

## 6) Instruments and Indicators

- Instruments used:
    - `custom Likert` (Evaluation form of E-Portfolio for digital universities).
- Main indicators/metrics:
    - Operational: `NR`
    - Usability/acceptance: `NR` (Evaluated for system "appropriateness" and "suitability" rather than direct end-user usability).
    - Governance: `traceability / auditability / role compliance` (Transparency, verification, and decentralized trust mechanisms embedded in blockchain properties).
- Reliability reported? `No`
    - If yes, value(s): `NR`

## 7) Statistical Treatment

- Descriptive statistics used: Mean, Standard Deviation (S.D.).
- Inferential statistics used: `NR`
- Effect size reported: `NR`
- If none, write: `NR`

## 8) Key Results (Numeric First)

- Result 1 (with value): The appropriateness of the input data components (objectives, users, content, devices) received an overall `mean = 4.83` out of 5 (`S.D. = 0.22`), rated as "Excellent".
- Result 2 (with value): The appropriateness of the system work process (e-portfolio workflow, blockchain, smart contracts, AI) received an overall `mean = 4.53` (`S.D. = 0.69`), rated as "Excellent".
- Result 3 (with value): The overall suitability of the eSCi-BCT model across all evaluation steps achieved a total `mean = 4.67` (`S.D. = 0.49`), rated as "Excellent".
- Authors' main conclusion (1-2 sentences): The eSCi-BCT model demonstrates high suitability for implementation in digital universities, offering a secure, immutable, and intelligent electronic portfolio framework that protects privacy and enhances the credibility of academic assessment.

## 9) Limitations (As Stated by Authors)

- Limitation 1: The study evaluates a conceptual framework and architectural model through expert opinion rather than empirical testing of a fully deployed software application. _(Note: Inferred, as authors do not explicitly list a limitations section)_
- Limitation 2: `NR`
- Limitation 3: `NR`

## 10) Relevance to FPMS Study

- Directly useful SOP item(s): governance (traceability, auditability, role-based access)
- What gap remains after this study? The study proposes a macro-level, highly conceptual model for securing general student e-portfolios using blockchain and AI. It entirely lacks actionable workflows for _faculty_ evaluation processes, strict required-document compliance tracking for QA, and measurable administrative metrics like review turnaround times.
- Transferability to my FPMS context: Low
- Why? While the domain touches on e-portfolios and HEI systems, the target users are predominantly students, and the technology stack (Blockchain/Smart Contracts) differs completely from a PHP/Laravel workflow system. The evaluation metrics address the theoretical suitability of blockchain features rather than the operational, measurable outcomes (turnaround, completeness, usability) required for building your FPMS.

## 11) Matrix-Ready Summary (Copy to Chapter II)

- Authors (Year): Tasatanattakool, Pradit, and Piriyasurawong (2023)
- Objective: To synthesize, develop, and evaluate an electronic portfolio format for digital universities utilizing smart contracts and intelligence blockchain technology.
- Method/system type: DSR / Conceptual Model (eSCi-BCT)
- Data/sample: n = 9 experts (IT, AI, and educational communications professionals).
- Metrics: Suitability/appropriateness scores of the conceptual framework (Mean and S.D.).
- Key finding: Experts rated the overall conceptual model as "Excellent" (mean = 4.67), validating the integration of blockchain, smart contracts, and AI as a theoretically sound approach to securing e-portfolio data and enforcing decentralized trust.
- Limitation: The framework remains conceptual and was validated via expert survey rather than through empirical operational testing of a deployed application.
- Gap relevant to FPMS: The study focuses on advanced blockchain/AI architectures for student portfolios; it lacks the specific procedural workflows, compliance tracking features, and turnaround time metrics necessary for a faculty portfolio management system.

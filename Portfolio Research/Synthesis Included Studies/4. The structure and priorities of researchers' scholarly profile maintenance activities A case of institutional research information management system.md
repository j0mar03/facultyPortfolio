## 2) Study Focus

- Problem addressed (1-2 sentences): Institutional Research Information Management Systems (RIMS) rely heavily on profile owners' manual curation to ensure data completeness and quality, but the structure and priorities of researchers' profile maintenance activities are not well understood.
- Main objective/research question: To investigate the action structure of researchers’ scholarly profile maintenance activities in an institutional RIMS and the relationships between these actions and researchers’ characteristics.
- Domain/context: `e-portfolio / HEI management / RIMS`

## 3) System/Artifact Description

- System type: `web-based` (Scholars@TAMU based on VIVO open-source software)
- Target users/roles: Faculty members / Researchers
- Core modules/features:
    - Profile editor
    - Identity and expertise data management
    - Publication curation/claiming
- Workflow scope covered:
    - Submission: Yes (adding/claiming publications)
    - Review/approval: `NR`
    - Compliance checking: `NR`
    - Reporting/export: `NR`
    - Role-based access: `NR`

## 4) Methodology

- Research design: `case study / quantitative` (Log data analysis)
- Development approach (if any): `NR`
- Evaluation design: Statistical analysis of user session log data utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), generalized linear models, and mediation analysis.
- Study setting and duration: Texas A&M University; duration `NR` (data evaluated up to May 19, 2022).

## 5) Participants and Data

- Unit of analysis: User sessions
- Sample size (n): 3,738 faculty members (across 27,249 user sessions)
- Participant profile: Assistant, Associate, and Full Professors from multiple disciplines (Life Sciences, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.)
- Data sources:
    - `system logs`
- Inclusion/exclusion (if reported): Included currently available profiles of faculty who made at least a single login and data input to the editor; excluded the "Others" seniority group for specific group analyses to remove noise.

## 6) Instruments and Indicators

- Instruments used:
    - `system logs / time logs`
- Main indicators/metrics:
    - Operational: `processing time` (session duration), summated frequency of update events
    - Usability/acceptance: `completeness` (adding metadata, updating profile data)
    - Governance: `NR`
- Reliability reported? `Yes`
    - If yes, value(s): `Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA) = 0.859` (for the PCA model).

## 7) Statistical Treatment

- Descriptive statistics used: Mean, frequency
- Inferential statistics used: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Generalized linear model with gamma, Bonferroni post-hoc test, Multiple linear regression, Sobel test
- Effect size reported: `NR` (Factor loadings ≥ 0.40 were considered significant)
- If none, write: `NR`

## 8) Key Results (Numeric First)

- Result 1 (with value): The average session duration for updating the RIMS profile was **`mean = 3.08 minutes`**.
- Result 2 (with value): "Claim publication" was the most frequent user action with a **`mean summated frequency = 0.5609`**.
- Result 3 (with value): `qualitative claim` - **Female researchers and junior researchers** (assistant/associate professors) completed profile updates and maintenance actions significantly more often than male and senior researchers.
- Authors' main conclusion (1-2 sentences): Researchers prioritize updating their profiles by adding publications, enhancing their researcher identity, and improving research discoverability. Understanding that junior and female researchers engage more actively can help institutions design tailored profile maintenance templates and communication strategies.

## 9) Limitations (As Stated by Authors)

- Limitation 1: The study is based on a single institutional RIMS, which may reflect only that specific institution's goals and missions.
- Limitation 2: Gender was treated as a binary value, which might misrepresent the gender identity of some researchers in the sample.
- Limitation 3: The analysis was not conducted by academic discipline because different departments showed varying levels of engagement due to the system's slow, staggered rollout.

## 10) Relevance to FPMS Study

- Directly useful SOP item(s): usability / completeness
- What gap remains after this study? The study thoroughly explores the _voluntary_ self-curation of e-portfolios (RIMS) for academic discoverability but entirely lacks the structured _administrative workflows_ required for faculty evaluation, such as QA compliance tracking, required-document checklists, and review turnaround times.
- Transferability to my FPMS context: Medium
- Why? The target system (Scholars@TAMU) is a related web-based higher education e-portfolio system that measures faculty system engagement, profile data completeness, and session usability metrics. However, there is only partial overlap, as its primary purpose is public research visibility rather than an internal, mandatory workflow for institutional compliance and evaluation.

## 11) Matrix-Ready Summary (Copy to Chapter II)

- Authors (Year): Lee, Stvilia, Ha, and Hahn (2023)
- Objective: To investigate the structure and priorities of faculty members' scholarly profile maintenance activities in an institutional Research Information Management System (RIMS).
- Method/system type: Case study / Web-based RIMS (VIVO)
- Data/sample: n = 3,738 faculty members (analyzing 27,249 system log sessions).
- Metrics: Session duration (processing time) and frequencies of specific data completeness actions (e.g., claiming publications, updating names).
- Key finding: Faculty organize their system interactions into three main activities: adding publications, enhancing identity, and improving discoverability. Junior and female researchers demonstrated significantly higher engagement and completeness rates.
- Limitation: The findings reflect a single institution's rollout strategy and did not analyze workflow variances across different academic disciplines.
- Gap relevant to FPMS: While the study offers insights into faculty e-portfolio usability and self-curation completeness, it operates outside of formal evaluation processes, leaving a gap regarding mandatory submission workflows, compliance checking, and administrative review metrics.

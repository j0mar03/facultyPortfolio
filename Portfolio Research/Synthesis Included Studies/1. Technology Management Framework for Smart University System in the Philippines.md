## 2) Study Focus

- Problem addressed (1-2 sentences): Traditional universities need a structured path to transform into "Smart Universities" to become more efficient, effective, and collaborative, but there are distinct prerequisites, issues, and challenges to adopting this in the Philippines,.
- Main objective/research question: To develop a Technology Management Framework that addresses the challenges of establishing a Smart University in the Philippines, and to measure the smartness level of selected universities in Metro Manila.
- Domain/context: `HEI management / Smart University`,

## 3) System/Artifact Description

- System type: `framework`
- Target users/roles: Students, teachers, university administrators, and IT practitioners/government agencies,.
- Core modules/features:
    - Technology Infrastructure, Educational Pedagogy, Government Collaboration (3 Pillars).
    - Academic System (Smart Monitoring Tools, Faculty & Employee Evaluation System),.
    - Governance (Financial Management System, Administration Services, Risk Management),.
- Workflow scope covered:
    - Submission: `NR`
    - Review/approval: `NR`
    - Compliance checking: `NR`
    - Reporting/export: `NR`
    - Role-based access: `NR`

## 4) Methodology

- Research design: `mixed` (sequential exploratory design),,.
- Development approach: `NR`
- Evaluation design: Qualitative data was collected via Nominal Group Technique (NGT) to develop the framework, followed by quantitative surveys to measure the "Level of Smartness" across universities,,.
- Study setting and duration: Metro Manila, Philippines. Duration `NR`.

## 5) Participants and Data

- Unit of analysis: Individual stakeholders (for framework formulation) and Institutions (for smartness level evaluation),.
- Sample size (n): 160 respondents.
- Participant profile: 104 students, 35 teachers, 11 university administrators, 10 IT experts.
- Data sources:
    - `survey / interview` (Nominal Group Technique),.
- Inclusion/exclusion (if reported): Purposive sampling was used to logically represent the population; IT experts were selected using a Knowledge Resource Nomination Worksheet,.

## 6) Instruments and Indicators

- Instruments used:
    - `custom Likert` (7-point scale ranging from 0="Not applicable" to 7="Extremely Important"/"Far Above Standards").
- Main indicators/metrics:
    - Operational: `NR`
    - Usability/acceptance: `NR`
    - Governance: Smartness level ratings (Mean scores) of IT and administrative criteria.
- Reliability reported? `Yes`
    - If yes, value(s): `Cronbach's alpha = NR` (Authors note using Cronbach's alpha for the survey instruments but do not report the final numerical value),.

## 7) Statistical Treatment

- Descriptive statistics used: Mean, frequency, percentage,.
- Inferential statistics used: Friedman non-parametric hypothesis test.
- Effect size reported: `NR`
- If none, write: `NR`

## 8) Key Results (Numeric First)

- Result 1 (with value): In the Governance criterion, University #6 achieved the highest smartness level rating with a `mean = 5.14` (interpreted as approaching above standards).
- Result 2 (with value): In the Academic System criterion, University #6 obtained the highest smartness level with a `mean = 4.97`.
- Result 3 (with value): `qualitative claim` - Universities #1, #4, #6, and #7 achieved the "Managed Level" (Level 4), explicitly possessing Smart University entities and working policies.
- Authors' main conclusion (1-2 sentences): Establishing a Smart University in the Philippines requires integrating three core pillars (Technology Infrastructure, Educational Pedagogy, Government Collaboration) and five major criteria (Environment, EdTech, Academic System, Governance, Health Services). Adopting the proposed framework and roadmap will increase university efficiency, responsiveness, and stakeholder experience,.

## 9) Limitations (As Stated by Authors)

- Limitation 1: Developing applications for a Smart University framework is subject to restrictions regarding financials, duration, and organizational policies.
- Limitation 2: Due to limited resources, the survey instrument was not examined by a wider range of experts from government institutions or technology/telecommunication services,.
- Limitation 3: The study needs to be deployed across other diverse Higher Education Institutions (State Universities, Local Colleges, Sectarian/Non-Sectarian Private Institutions) to better assess national gaps,.

## 10) Relevance to FPMS Study

- Directly useful SOP item(s): governance
- What gap remains after this study? The study proposes a high-level conceptual IT management framework for university-wide digital transformation rather than the architectural or systemic operational mechanisms needed to build a specific faculty evaluation workflow. It completely lacks variables on review turnaround times, required document compliance tracking, and software usability metrics.
- Transferability to my FPMS context: Low
- Why? While the paper briefly mentions "Faculty Evaluation System" and "Governance" under its broad Smart University criteria, it contains no overlapping workflows, system architecture, or operational metrics that can be mapped to an FPMS. The scope is strictly macro-level policy and IT readiness in HEIs, making it irrelevant for extracting actionable software development or usability design elements.

## 11) Matrix-Ready Summary (Copy to Chapter II)

- Authors (Year): Fernando-Raguro, Lagman, and Juanatas (2021)
- Objective: To develop a Technology Management Framework to guide the transition of traditional universities in the Philippines into Smart Universities.
- Method/system type: Mixed methods / IT Management Framework
- Data/sample: n = 160 (students, teachers, administrators, IT experts) across 8 universities in Metro Manila.
- Metrics: Mean level of smartness across five qualitative HEI criteria (Learning Environment, Educational Technology, Academic System, Governance, Health Services).
- Key finding: 50% of the assessed universities reached a "Managed Level" of smartness, and the researchers established a 3-pillar, 5-criterion structural roadmap to standardize HEI technology adoption.
- Limitation: The validation sample was restricted geographically (Metro Manila) and lacked widespread expert input on telecom/government policy constraints.
- Gap relevant to FPMS: The study operates at a macro-institutional policy level, offering no granular workflow models, operational metrics (turnaround, completeness), or software usability indicators necessary for developing a targeted web-based faculty portfolio system.

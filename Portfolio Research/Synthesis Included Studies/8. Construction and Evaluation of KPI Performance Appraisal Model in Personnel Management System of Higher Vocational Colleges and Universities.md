## 2) Study Focus

- Problem addressed (1-2 sentences): Existing personnel performance appraisal systems in higher vocational colleges suffer from vague appraisal objectives and diffuse evaluation focus, leading staff to treat appraisals passively as mere tools for administrative promotion.
- Main objective/research question: To construct a KPI-based performance appraisal model using a tailored Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and to quantify the appropriateness of faculty performance indicators using the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method.
- Domain/context: `faculty evaluation / HEI management`

## 3) System/Artifact Description

- System type: `model` (Mathematical BSC and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model)
- Target users/roles: Counselors, teachers, and college management
- Core modules/features:
    - Students and society dimension (service satisfaction, social evaluation)
    - Teaching activities dimension (teaching quality, resources, professional construction)
    - Faculty development dimension (staff building, teacher improvement, growth)
    - Financial support dimension (mode of financing, fiscal charges)
- Workflow scope covered:
    - Submission: `NR`
    - Review/approval: `NR`
    - Compliance checking: `NR`
    - Reporting/export: `NR`
    - Role-based access: `NR`

## 4) Methodology

- Research design: `mixed` (Questionnaire survey and mathematical modeling)
- Development approach (if any): `NR`
- Evaluation design: Questionnaires were used to diagnose the current appraisal system's issues, followed by the practical application of the proposed fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model to calculate the overall performance results of a specific vocational college.
- Study setting and duration: A Vocational and Technical College (China); duration `NR`

## 5) Participants and Data

- Unit of analysis: Individual stakeholders (for the initial survey) and Institutional dimensions (for the fuzzy evaluation model)
- Sample size (n): 90 valid respondents (from 100 distributed questionnaires)
- Participant profile: Counselors (assistants), secondary school leadership, functional department heads, school party/government leadership, and students
- Data sources:
    - `survey` ("Performance Appraisal Questionnaire for Vocational Colleges")
- Inclusion/exclusion (if reported): `NR` (Notes 10 invalid questionnaires were excluded from the 100 distributed)

## 6) Instruments and Indicators

- Instruments used:
    - `custom Likert` (Custom questionnaire)
    - `Mathematical matrices` (Fuzzy comprehensive judgment matrices)
- Main indicators/metrics:
    - Operational: `NR`
    - Usability/acceptance: `NR`
    - Governance: KPI performance scores across four BSC dimensions
- Reliability reported? `No`
    - If yes, value(s): `NR` (Mentions using hierarchical analysis method for weights, but no reliability coefficients like Cronbach's alpha are reported)

## 7) Statistical Treatment

- Descriptive statistics used: Frequency, proportion (percentage)
- Inferential statistics used: Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, Hierarchical Analysis Method (AHP for determining weights)
- Effect size reported: `NR`
- If none, write: `NR`

## 8) Key Results (Numeric First)

- Result 1 (with value): 96.7% of surveyed individuals believed the goal of the current performance appraisal was to provide a basis for administrative promotion, reflecting vague developmental objectives.
- Result 2 (with value): 41.1% of respondents indicated that the current performance appraisal index system for counselors is imperfect ("not too perfect").
- Result 3 (with value): Applying the newly constructed fuzzy model, the final performance evaluation result of A Vocational and Technical College was calculated as `0.6264`, which is greater than the standard expected value of `0.6`.
- Authors' main conclusion (1-2 sentences): By addressing vague appraisal goals through a tailored Balanced Scorecard, the proposed KPI performance appraisal model using fuzzy comprehensive judgment provides a highly effective and scientific mathematical tool for evaluating personnel in higher vocational colleges.

## 9) Limitations (As Stated by Authors)

- Limitation 1: `NR`
- Limitation 2: `NR`
- Limitation 3: `NR`

## 10) Relevance to FPMS Study

- Directly useful SOP item(s): governance (KPI metrics mapping)
- What gap remains after this study? The study strictly proposes a mathematical algorithm and conceptual metric framework (BSC + fuzzy logic) for HR evaluation. It does not deploy an actual software application and completely lacks web-based workflows, automated required-document completeness tracking, and administrative review turnaround time metrics.
- Transferability to my FPMS context: Low
- Why? The paper focuses entirely on establishing mathematical HR KPIs and calculating evaluation weights rather than building software. It provides no software architecture, user interface considerations, or document submission workflows that can be practically applied to developing a Laravel-based FPMS.

## 11) Matrix-Ready Summary (Copy to Chapter II)

- Authors (Year): Zhao et al. (2024)
- Objective: To construct a KPI performance appraisal model for higher vocational colleges using a modified Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to resolve vague evaluation focuses.
- Method/system type: Mixed Methods / Mathematical Evaluation Model
- Data/sample: n = 90 survey respondents (staff, leaders, and students) to diagnose current issues, plus institutional data for model testing.
- Metrics: Proportions of user perceptions; mathematical fuzzy evaluation scores.
- Key finding: Current appraisal systems lack focus, with 41.1% of staff finding them imperfect. The proposed fuzzy BSC model successfully quantified institutional performance, yielding a favorable evaluation score of 0.6264 (against a 0.6 baseline standard).
- Limitation: `NR` (The study does not outline empirical or methodological limitations).
- Gap relevant to FPMS: The research presents a purely mathematical HR framework; it lacks any software-based workflow automation, document compliance checks, or review turnaround tracking needed to build a functional web-based portfolio management system.

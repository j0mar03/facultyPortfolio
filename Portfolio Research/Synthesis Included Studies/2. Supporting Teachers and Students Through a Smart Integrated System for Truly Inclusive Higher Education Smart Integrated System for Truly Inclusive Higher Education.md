## 2) Study Focus

- Problem addressed (1-2 sentences): Higher education institutions lack truly flexible, personalized, and inclusive education models, heavily impacted by rigid curricula and a widespread lack of knowledge regarding digital accessibility guidelines among teaching staff.
- Main objective/research question: To present the YachaY System, which aims to support students, teachers, academic authorities, and the productive sector in making education flexible, personalized, and inclusive through an integrated ecosystem.
- Domain/context: `e-portfolio / inclusive education / HEI management`

## 3) System/Artifact Description

- System type: `web-based / integrated system` (Microservices/API Gateway architecture)
- Target users/roles: Students, teachers, academic managers, IT managers, and public/private employers.
- Core modules/features:
    - Portable e-Profile (for learning personalization and accessibility preferences)
    - Portable e-Portfolio and Unified Credential System (blockchain-based digital badges)
    - Learning Path Recommender System and Intelligent Chatbot Support
- Workflow scope covered:
    - Submission: `NR`
    - Review/approval: `NR`
    - Compliance checking: `NR`
    - Reporting/export: Yes (e-portfolio allows exporting/sharing credentials externally)
    - Role-based access: Yes (distinct interfaces for external actors, admins, teachers, and students)

## 4) Methodology

- Research design: `descriptive / DSR` (conceptual system architecture presentation).
- Development approach (if any): `Agile / Microservices` (mentions Microservices/API Gateway pattern with REST interfaces).
- Evaluation design: The system is under development; pedagogical pilot testing is planned via an international postgraduate course (Diploma in Climate Change), but no evaluation of the complete system is reported.
- Study setting and duration: Latin America and Europe (Erasmus+ program). Duration `NR`.

## 5) Participants and Data

_Note: The authors report on a survey from a partner project (eTeACHERS) to justify the system's need._

- Unit of analysis: Individual teachers and student service technicians.
- Sample size (n): `NR` (only percentages provided).
- Participant profile: University teaching staff and IT/student service technicians from three European universities.
- Data sources:
    - `survey` (questionnaires on accessibility knowledge).
- Inclusion/exclusion (if reported): `NR`

## 6) Instruments and Indicators

- Instruments used:
    - `custom survey` (questionnaires on general knowledge of accessibility, WCAG, and good practices in digital content creation).
- Main indicators/metrics:
    - Operational: `NR`
    - Usability/acceptance: `NR`
    - Governance: `NR`
- Reliability reported? `No`
    - If yes, value(s): `NR`

## 7) Statistical Treatment

- Descriptive statistics used: Percentages.
- Inferential statistics used: `NR`
- Effect size reported: `NR`
- If none, write: `NR`

## 8) Key Results (Numeric First)

- Result 1 (with value): 43% of teachers surveyed stated they have not heard of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), and 74% declare not knowing the European directive on accessibility.
- Result 2 (with value): 41% of surveyed teachers and 5% of technicians declared that they do not know what an alternative text (alt text) is when inserting an image.
- Result 3 (with value): `qualitative claim` - Ignorance of accessibility guidelines leads to harmful myths among educators, such as believing that creating accessible documents requires eliminating visual elements or using only very large text.
- Authors' main conclusion (1-2 sentences): Implementing a smart integrated system with e-profiles, e-portfolios, and AI tools can empower users and successfully bridge the gap to achieve flexible, accessible, and inclusive 21st-century higher education.

## 9) Limitations (As Stated by Authors)

- Limitation 1: The system is still under development and has not been fully implemented or evaluated.
- Limitation 2: Implementing the system requires a considerable institutional shift, as most participating universities do not currently work with flexible curricula or true attention to diversity.
- Limitation 3: `NR`

## 10) Relevance to FPMS Study

- Directly useful SOP item(s): usability (strong emphasis on digital accessibility principles).
- What gap remains after this study? The study focuses on student-centric portfolios and learning-path recommendations for inclusivity and job market credentials. It lacks technical frameworks and workflows for faculty-specific evaluation, required document compliance tracking, and administrative review turnaround times.
- Transferability to my FPMS context: Low
- Why? While the paper details an e-portfolio ecosystem within higher education, its primary target is student accessibility, curriculum flexibility, and micro-credentialing. It does not address faculty evaluation processes, the submission workflow for quality assurance (QA) compliance, or metrics related to processing turnaround, making the architecture non-transferable to the FPMS context.

## 11) Matrix-Ready Summary (Copy to Chapter II)

- Authors (Year): Gutiérrez y Restrepo and Floris (2022)
- Objective: To present the YachaY integrated system designed to support personalized, flexible, and inclusive higher education through e-portfolios, e-profiles, and AI chatbots.
- Method/system type: Descriptive / Microservices-based Integrated System Architecture
- Data/sample: `NR` sample size (presents survey percentages of teachers and technicians from 3 universities).
- Metrics: Percentages of staff unaware of web accessibility guidelines (WCAG) and alternative text functionality.
- Key finding: There is a profound lack of digital accessibility knowledge among HEI staff (e.g., 74% unaware of accessibility directives), justifying the need for systems that automate and embed inclusivity via personalizable e-profiles and automated chat support.
- Limitation: The proposed framework is strictly conceptual and remains under development, lacking empirical testing of the software's operational effectiveness.
- Gap relevant to FPMS: The study's focus on student learning pathways and micro-credentialing offers no actionable insights or operational models for faculty evaluation workflows, required-document compliance checking, or administrative review turnaround times.

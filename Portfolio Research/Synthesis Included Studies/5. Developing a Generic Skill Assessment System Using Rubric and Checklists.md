## 2) Study Focus

- Problem addressed (1-2 sentences): While higher education is shifting toward developing students' generic skills (e.g., communication, problem-solving), existing Learning Management Systems (LMS) and e-portfolio systems lack the structure to easily manage hierarchical assessment indexes (rubrics/checklists) without overburdening students and faculty with evidence-collection tasks.
- Main objective/research question: To clarify the requirements for a generic skill assessment system, implement its basic functions using technical standards (IMS LTI and CASE) for LMS interoperability, and verify its effectiveness in actual assessment activities.
- Domain/context: `student assessment / e-portfolio / HEI management`

## 3) System/Artifact Description

- System type: `web-based` (built using PHP's Laravel framework, Bootstrap4, and Font Awesome)
- Target users/roles: Students, Faculty members
- Core modules/features:
    - Assessment index management (rubrics and checklists with parent-child relationships mapped via IMS CASE)
    - Student self-assessment input interface and visual results browsing (radar charts)
    - Faculty dashboard to browse student assessment status and download results as CSV
- Workflow scope covered:
    - Submission: Yes (student self-assessment inputs)
    - Review/approval: `NR`
    - Compliance checking: `NR`
    - Reporting/export: Yes (faculty can download assessment results as a text/csv file)
    - Role-based access: Yes (linked with LMS via LTI for user ID authentication)

## 4) Methodology

- Research design: `DSR` (Design, implementation, and field trial evaluation)
- Development approach (if any): MVC model web application utilizing open-source software and standard specifications (IMS LTI, IMS CASE)
- Evaluation design: Field trial during an "Achievement Confirmation Workshop," followed by a post-use student questionnaire to evaluate usability and preference compared to a prior spreadsheet-based method.
- Study setting and duration: Department of Information and Electronic Engineering, Teikyo University; the assessment activities were carried out from January 22 to February 5, 2021.

## 5) Participants and Data

- Unit of analysis: Individual students
- Sample size (n): 51
- Participant profile: 4th-year university students completing self-assessment activities
- Data sources:
    - `survey` (post-use questionnaire)
- Inclusion/exclusion (if reported): Included fourth-year students who completed all self-assessment activities and answered the questionnaire (51 out of 59 students).

## 6) Instruments and Indicators

- Instruments used:
    - `custom Likert` (questionnaire with scaled choices regarding system preference and understanding of skills)
- Main indicators/metrics:
    - Operational: `NR`
    - Usability/acceptance: System preference (web-based vs. spreadsheet), perceived ease of use
    - Governance: `NR`
- Reliability reported? `No`
    - If yes, value(s): `NR`

## 7) Statistical Treatment

- Descriptive statistics used: Percentages, frequencies
- Inferential statistics used: `NR`
- Effect size reported: `NR`
- If none, write: `NR`

## 8) Key Results (Numeric First)

- Result 1 (with value): 82% of the students supported the new system over the traditional spreadsheet method (with 72% stating they "Like this web-based system" and 10% stating they "Rather like this web-based system").
- Result 2 (with value): `qualitative claim` - Students reported that the web-based system was easier to read, fill in (via clicking rather than typing into spreadsheets), and visually helpful for understanding strengths and weaknesses through automated diagrams.
- Result 3 (with value): `qualitative claim` - Faculty members confirmed that the system was easy to use from an administrative perspective for setting up assessment tasks on the LMS and checking student response statuses.
- Authors' main conclusion (1-2 sentences): A dedicated web-based generic skill assessment system, designed with IMS CASE database schemas and interoperable with LMS via LTI, is highly useful for both students and faculty, successfully replacing cumbersome spreadsheet-based assessment workflows.

## 9) Limitations (As Stated by Authors)

- Limitation 1: The initial implementation lacked a function to handle assessment tasks for "overall generic skills" in a single view, forcing students to frustratingly return to the LMS menu for each specific checklist item.
- Limitation 2: The system's usefulness as an assessment tool needs to be verified through long-term usage rather than a single workshop.
- Limitation 3: The system's effectiveness must be investigated across different educational contexts, institutions, and curricula.

## 10) Relevance to FPMS Study

- Directly useful SOP item(s): usability / workflow improvement (transitioning from manual spreadsheets to a web-based database system)
- What gap remains after this study? The system focuses purely on _student_ self-assessment of generic skills and lacks the administrative workflows required for formal _faculty_ evaluation. It completely lacks required-document compliance tracking, review/approval steps by chairs/admins, and review turnaround time metrics.
- Transferability to my FPMS context: Medium
- Why? There is strong architectural overlap: both systems are built using PHP Laravel for higher education institutions to digitize previously manual (spreadsheet-based) rubric/checklist evaluations. However, the users (students vs. faculty) and the specific workflows (self-assessment vs. mandatory QA compliance) differ, meaning the specific backend workflows will require adaptation.

## 11) Matrix-Ready Summary (Copy to Chapter II)

- Authors (Year): Miyazaki, Watanabe, Masaka, and Takai (2021)
- Objective: To develop and evaluate a web-based generic skill assessment system that uses rubrics/checklists and integrates with existing Learning Management Systems (LMS).
- Method/system type: DSR / Web-based Assessment System (PHP Laravel)
- Data/sample: n = 51 fourth-year engineering students.
- Metrics: Usability and system preference (percentages based on custom survey).
- Key finding: 82% of students preferred the new web-based Laravel system over traditional spreadsheet assessments due to its ease of clicking, readability, and visual results (radar charts).
- Limitation: The first iteration lacked a unified interface for assessing all skill items at once, and longitudinal effectiveness across diverse educational contexts remains untested.
- Gap relevant to FPMS: The study designs an excellent PHP Laravel architecture for educational rubrics, but targets student self-assessment; it lacks the governance workflows (compliance checking, chair approvals, turnaround tracking) required for a faculty portfolio management system.

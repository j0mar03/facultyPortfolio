## 2) Study Focus

- Problem addressed (1-2 sentences): The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted traditional face-to-face education in Nigeria, forcing institutions to rely on ineffective distance education alternatives like television and radio that lack proper monitoring and evaluation of student learning.
- Main objective/research question: To design and implement an interactive Collaborative Learning Management System (CLMS) that assists instructors in organizing content, collaborating, and monitoring students' online distance education.
- Domain/context: `e-portfolio / HEI management / collaborative learning`

## 3) System/Artifact Description

- System type: `web-based / mobile` (Interactive online and android-based system using PHP and MySQL)
- Target users/roles: Admin, Instructor, Student
- Core modules/features:
    - Interactive board/chat box for collaboration
    - E-portfolio acting as a repository storage of learning materials
    - Quiz, assessment utilities, and notification systems
- Workflow scope covered:
    - Submission: Yes (student assignment and quiz submission)
    - Review/approval: `NR`
    - Compliance checking: `NR`
    - Reporting/export: Yes (instructors generate reports for assessment-based participations)
    - Role-based access: Yes (distinct menus and privileges for Admin, Instructor, and Student)

## 4) Methodology

- Research design: `DSR` (System Design and Implementation)
- Development approach (if any): `Agile` (Rapid Application Development - RAD methodology)
- Evaluation design: Software feasibility testing, including Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and Alpha Testing using sample data.
- Study setting and duration: `NR`

## 5) Participants and Data

- Unit of analysis: System modules
- Sample size (n): `NR` (Tested with sample data; human participants deferred to future work)
- Participant profile: `NR`
- Data sources:
    - `system logs / testing data` (Alpha testing using sample data)
- Inclusion/exclusion (if reported): `NR`

## 6) Instruments and Indicators

- Instruments used:
    - `checklist` (Unit and Integration testing functionality checks)
- Main indicators/metrics:
    - Operational: `error rate` (identifying and correcting errors to ensure functionality)
    - Usability/acceptance: `NR`
    - Governance: `role compliance` (Admin capabilities to manage instructors/students)
- Reliability reported? `No`
    - If yes, value(s): `NR`

## 7) Statistical Treatment

- Descriptive statistics used: `NR`
- Inferential statistics used: `NR`
- Effect size reported: `NR`
- If none, write: `NR`

## 8) Key Results (Numeric First)

- Result 1 (with value): `qualitative claim` - The CLMS successfully passed Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and Alpha Testing with sample real-time data, proving to be error-free and properly functional.
- Result 2 (with value): `qualitative claim` - The integration of an e-portfolio successfully centralized a repository for study materials, allowing students distance access.
- Result 3 (with value): `qualitative claim` - The system's RAD implementation resulted in a robust, web-based (PHP/MySQL) platform that successfully creates role-based segregation for admins, instructors, and students.
- Authors' main conclusion (1-2 sentences): The implementation of the Collaborative Learning Management System (CLMS) successfully provides an integrated, interactive platform that overcomes the challenges of conventional learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling easy knowledge management, assessments, and collaborative interactions.

## 9) Limitations (As Stated by Authors)

- Limitation 1: The study has not yet evaluated the system with actual human end-users in a live educational setting to measure user perception and efficacy.
- Limitation 2: Evaluation is limited to software feasibility and alpha testing using sample data rather than live operational data.
- Limitation 3: `NR`

## 10) Relevance to FPMS Study

1. Directly useful SOP item(s): governance (role-based access)
2. What gap remains after this study? The study focuses solely on student-instructor learning workflows (e.g., submitting class assignments, downloading materials) rather than administrative compliance workflows. It utilizes the term "e-portfolio," but purely as a file repository for course materials rather than a faculty evaluation portfolio, leaving gaps in tracking required-document completeness, review turnaround times, and QA approvals.
3. Transferability to my FPMS context: Low
4. Why? Although this system is a web-based tool utilizing role-based access for higher education, its core domain is a Learning Management System (LMS) designed for teaching students. The system's architecture, workflows, and "e-portfolio" functions completely lack relevance to faculty performance evaluation, institutional QA compliance checks, and operational review metrics like turnaround time.

## 11) Matrix-Ready Summary (Copy to Chapter II)

- Authors (Year): Ikwunne et al. (2021)
- Objective: To design and implement a web-based Collaborative Learning Management System (CLMS) to facilitate distance education and mitigate the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.
- Method/system type: DSR / Web-based Collaborative Learning Management System
- Data/sample: `NR` (Software was evaluated using technical sample data for Alpha testing).
- Metrics: Software error detection via Unit, Integration, and Alpha testing.
- Key finding: `qualitative claim` - Utilizing Rapid Application Development (RAD), the authors successfully built an interactive PHP/MySQL system that enforces role-based access (Admin, Instructor, Student) and integrates an e-portfolio repository for digital learning materials.
- Limitation: The study's evaluation is limited strictly to technical software testing and lacks empirical measurement of user acceptance, efficacy, or pedagogical impact in a live educational environment.
- Gap relevant to FPMS: The study builds a student-centric LMS where "e-portfolio" strictly means a study material repository; it provides no architectural or operational mechanisms for faculty evaluation workflows, required QA document compliance, or review turnaround times.

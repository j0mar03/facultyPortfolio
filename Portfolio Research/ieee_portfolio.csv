An effective system requires several key ingredients, such as clarifying educational goals, organizing curriculums that align with those goals, and assessing learning outcomes. Institutional research for educational data management has been recognized as a key factor in the management system. Although it is imperative to develop teaching skills and capabilities of faculty, who are directly responsible for student learning outcomes, faculty development (FD) receives little attention. This paper aims to discuss how FD should be conducted to further advance Japanese higher education. Specifically, it will present results of a survey conducted to explore future trends in FD. Then, by comparing FD in the United States and Japan, this paper highlights similarities and differences in both countries and suggests future directions for FD in Japanese higher education.","2770-8470","978-1-6654-2420-2","10.1109/IIAI-AAI53430.2021.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9791068","faculty development;higher education;quantitative text analysis;comparative analysis","Quality assurance;Education;Market research;Informatics","","","","7","IEEE","13 Jun 2022","11-16 July 2021","11-16 July 2021","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using the identified performance indicators, this study aims to elicit insights from the dataset extracted from the Faculty Performance Evaluation System (FPES) of the Camarines Sur Polytechnic Colleges (CSPC) to understand how the students perceived their respective instructors' performance levels prior to and at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Generated patterns were uncovered using descriptive analysis based on the students' ratings. Meanwhile, the students' comments, suggestions, and recommendations were analyzed using Sentiment Analysis through TextBlob. The same dataset was further examined to recommend a prescribed action using a supervised learning method (Decision Tree Algorithm). With 98% model accuracy, faculty performance testing dataset were provided with prescribed actions with the following rules: Outstanding & Very Satisfactory Ratings = Re-Hire/No Action Needed; Satisfactory = Mentorship; Unsatisfactory & Poor = Re-Training & Re- Evaluation. The study discovered a decline in the faculty performance evaluation results at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This includes faculty ranking and evaluation. In this study, the development of a web and mobile application for automating the process of re-ranking faculty members of National University in the Philippines is focused. The purpose of the study is to address the inefficiency and accuracy of the current manual re-ranking process. The mentioned manual process is time-consuming and riddled with errors due to file duplication and unruly storage systems. Previous studies pointed out the use of technology in the educational industry but did not provide enough evidence how the faculty re-ranking process can be automated. This research, therefore, will fill this gap that can ease and secure faculty credential management by creating a system. This will enhance decision-making via data analytics and can improve workflow efficiency in the Faculty Service Office. There will be two methodologies that will be used for this study: Descriptive and Agile. This will be used together to identify the current challenges using interviews and surveys. This will be followed by an Agile Kanban Framework application in the development of the application. The findings indicate that the proposed system significantly reduces processing time, minimizes errors, and provides insights through data analytics to ensure a more effective and efficient way of faculty management. It shows that any educational institution will perform better if it automates its administrative process for proper utilization of its resources.","","979-8-3315-1155-5","10.1109/IC4e65071.2025.11075508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11075508","Information and Communication Technology;ICT;Faculty Ranking;Web and Mobile Application;Re-ranking;Faculty;Educational;Data Analytics","Surveys;Data analysis;Electronic learning;Decision making;Rapid prototyping;Mobile applications;Information and communication technology;Resource management;Reliability;Testing","","","","12","IEEE","16 Jul 2025","26-29 April 2025","26-29 April 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, conventional evaluation methods are error-prone, erroneous, and subjective. This paper proposes an integrated web-based Faculty Appraisal System developed on the LAMP stack, with Python-powered analytics and visualization, thus enabling a role-based dashboard for students, faculty, HODs, HRM in-charges, principals, IQAC, and HR/COE, allowing multi-tier verification. The faculties submit their self-appraisal in academic mentorship (40%), research development (40%), and contribution activities (20%), and the students give structured feedback. This system adopts AHP to deduce weighted evaluation criteria in a structured method, thus ensuring consistent and structured scoring. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) ranks faculty by comparing performances with ideal marks and hence guarantees fairness and objectivity. The proposed models have been integrated with Random Forest algorithms so as to enhance predictive accuracy and analyze historical data for classification, clustering, and performance prediction. EDA has been embedded to automate data cleaning, outlier detection, and visualization through bar and pie charts so that the reliability and transparency of data increase. An automated scoring engine assists growth-oriented decisions and incentive distribution, reduces bias, and enables real-time institutional analytics and adaptive policy refinement. Experimental deployment of the proposed system verifies its robustness in fostering a consistent data-driven process for faculty appraisals, which also points toward a roadmap for institutional excellence.","","979-8-3315-8242-5","10.1109/ICECMSN68058.2025.11382859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11382859","Index Terms-Faculty Appraisal System;AHP;TOPSIS;Random Forest;Multi-level Verification;Exploratory Data Analysis;Data Mining;Classification;Clustering;Visualization;Institutional Governance","Education;Data visualization;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Robustness;Real-time systems;Appraisal;Indexes;Random forests;Engines","","","","13","IEEE","17 Feb 2026","24-26 Nov. 2025","24-26 Nov. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

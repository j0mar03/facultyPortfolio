In engineering education, it has been proved to support courses and improve students’ performance. However, the acceptance issue of Moodle by engineering students in the context of China has not been fully explored. This study aimed to investigate the influential factors for engineering students to adopt Moodle in their learning. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was utilized and extended by adding four variables. Data was collected through a survey on 175 students in Glasgow College in China and partial least squares structural equation model (PLSSEM) was performed for analysis. The adapted model achieved a good fit and satisfactory explained variance. Results indicated that the two factors, Perceived ease of use (PEU) and perceived usefulness (PU), remained key determinants of students’ behavioral intention (BI) to use Moodle. The best predictor of both PEU and PU was perceived self-efficacy, and other variables, subjective norm, technological complexity and facilitating conditions, were all shown to have significant influence on the two determinants. This study sheds light on understanding Moodle acceptance in the new context of engineering education in China and could provide guidance to stakeholders when implementing the system in their course.","2024-04-11","2026-03-01 03:33:00","2026-03-01 03:33:00","2026-03-01 03:33:00","77-83","","","","","","Investigating Factors that Influence Engineering Students'Intention to Use Moodle","","","","","ACM","Macau China","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\ITECH\Zotero\storage\DCNYRFSZ\Luo and Yuan - 2024 - Investigating Factors that Influence Engineering Students'Intention to Use Moodle A Case Study in C.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ICETT 2024: 2024 10th International Conference on Education and Training Technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Academic Affairs Technology (AATECH) was charged with scaling the original application, providing training, and implementing the application for use in all colleges and schools. A phased approach was selected for this project implementation. Initial phases included: phase 1 (scaling the application), phase 2 (reports and major improvements), and phase 3 (annual maintenance).

The research provides evidence both on the use of the technological tool and the instructive task performed with it. Based on a survey of 112 professors, the tools were classified into items of mobile and social media (SM), learning management systems (LMS) and graphic and dynamic visualizations (Graphic). Regarding the Faculty, the study collected a number of sociodemographic variables such as gender, age, discipline, academic background and experience in online teaching. Results show the limited use of technology in classroom, highlighting only those technologies related with graphic and dynamic presentations, while they do show correlation between the use of LMS tools and SM tools. However, significant differences in the use of technology in the classroom have been found between teachers from different disciplines, academic backgrounds and prior experience with online teaching, while no differences were detected in other variables. This investigation thus contributes to studies that aim to advance the effective integration of technology in teaching and learning by introducing relevant teacher variables.","2016-11-02","2026-03-01 03:33:07","2026-03-01 03:33:07","2026-03-01 03:33:07","671-676","","","","","","","","","","","ACM","Salamanca Spain","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\ITECH\Zotero\storage\7SX4L8K5\Cubeles and Riu - 2016 - Teachers' use of technology in the university classroom.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","TEEM'16: 4th International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To deal with this reality, the researcher developed a framework for transforming a traditional university into a Smart University, which is more efficient, effective, and has more involvement from both students and teachers, all working together to accomplish the shared goal of improved learning. To achieve this objective, the researchers propose to develop a Technology Management Framework that will address issues and challenges to be considered in establishing and adopting a Smart University in the Philippines. The study will also measure the level of preparedness on Smart Universities among the students, teachers, university administrators, and IT consultant and practitioners that serve in different government agencies.

Increasingly, academic computing service groups find themselves trying to decide when and how quickly to deploy new online services. As new forms of commercial and open source web-based applications become available at a quickening pace, for instance, questions arise as to whether a significant number of local users would actually use them. Moreover, the widespread use of XML and stylesheets as underlying presentation technologies in these web applications present academic support groups with even more deployment decisions, such as whether or not to invest time and resources in refining a particular web application’s user interface. As described in this paper, these kinds of challenges can sometimes be met in a fairly easy and affordable way by drawing upon 1) recent developments in web survey technology along with 2) any of several models and constructs developed over the past two decades to help predict users’ technology choices. Specifically, this paper describes a workin-progress to develop an approach towards combining web survey systems together with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), in order to anticipate the usability and usefulness ratings among several candidate iterations of ePortfolio templates under consideration for deployment in one university setting.","2005-11-06","2026-03-01 03:33:15","2026-03-01 03:33:15","2026-03-01 03:33:15","214-217","","","","","","Gauging adoptability","","","","","ACM","Monterey CA USA","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\ITECH\Zotero\storage\2Q2S567K\McGrath - 2005 - Gauging adoptability a case study of e-portfolio template development.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","SIGUCCS Fall05: ACM SIGUCCS Fall Conference:Fishing for New Ideas","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

# CHAPTER II
## REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE AND STUDIES

### Introduction
The shift from manual to digital processes in higher education has expanded from classroom delivery systems to institutional governance functions such as faculty evaluation, compliance monitoring, and quality assurance documentation. In the context of faculty portfolio management, institutions increasingly require systems that can centralize document handling, enforce accountability, and support audit-ready reporting. This chapter synthesizes the current evidence base using a thematic approach, with eight full-text studies as core references and eight abstract-only studies as supplementary trend indicators. The synthesis is organized around five themes: faculty workflow digitalization, e-portfolio design support, quality assurance and governance alignment, information and records management behavior, and methodological evidence quality.

### Theme 1: Faculty Workflow Digitalization in Higher Education
Recent studies consistently show that digitizing faculty-related administrative workflows can reduce process inefficiencies and improve institutional coordination. Reyes et al. (2023), through the FEDesk system at the University of Santo Tomas, demonstrated that a web and mobile document management approach can improve traceability and user experience in faculty evaluation operations. Their study reported a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 74.90, high technical test performance, and stable response-time behavior, supporting the feasibility of role-aware digital document workflows in a real university office setting. Similarly, Balisi et al. (2025) reported that automating faculty ranking processes in a Philippine university context reduced processing burden and manual errors, indicating that faculty service offices benefit significantly from workflow automation.

Complementing these findings, Srija et al. (2025) introduced a data-driven faculty appraisal framework integrating AHP, TOPSIS, and Random Forest, emphasizing transparency and multi-role verification in appraisal workflows. Although focused on appraisal rather than portfolio compliance, the study reinforces the governance value of structured digital processes and role-separated responsibilities. Zhao et al. (2024) also addressed appraisal quality using a KPI-based model and fuzzy evaluation, finding deficiencies in existing appraisal clarity and demonstrating the utility of structured performance indicators. However, unlike FPMS-oriented workflow systems, their approach remains largely model-centric rather than operationally implemented as an end-to-end submission-review platform.

Abstract-only studies in this theme, including works by Balisi et al. (2025), Srija et al. (2025), and Zakaria et al. (2025), further suggest growing momentum toward automation and analytics in faculty-related processes. However, due to limited methodological and metric details in abstract-only records, these are treated as directional support rather than strong empirical anchors.

### Theme 2: E-Portfolio Design and Assessment Support
E-portfolio literature provides important conceptual and technical foundations for portfolio-centered systems, particularly in documenting academic outputs and supporting reflection or review activities. Tasatanattakool et al. (2023) proposed an e-portfolio architecture integrating smart contracts and blockchain logic, with expert ratings indicating strong conceptual suitability. While the model highlights trust, security, and decentralization benefits, the evidence remains conceptual and does not yet establish operational effectiveness in routine institutional workflows.

Gantikow et al. (2024) examined interactive concept maps generated from e-portfolio text and found potential usability and motivational benefits when analytic tools are integrated into authoring and review processes. This contributes a useful perspective for feature-level enhancement of portfolio review interfaces. Likewise, Miyazaki et al. (2021), though focusing on student skill assessment rather than faculty compliance portfolios, showed that a Laravel-based web system can outperform spreadsheet-based procedures in usability preference, indicating that interface structure and workflow clarity materially influence adoption.

Badouri et al. (2025), as an abstract-only study, extends this theme by proposing a conceptual framework for medical e-portfolios with emphasis on reflective practice and transition readiness. Together, these studies suggest that e-portfolio systems can provide strong pedagogical and documentation benefits, but many currently available designs are either domain-specific or conceptual and do not yet address mandatory faculty compliance controls such as required-document checking and review turnaround management.

### Theme 3: Quality Assurance, Accreditation, and Governance Alignment
A recurring pattern across the literature is that quality assurance and accreditation pressures are major drivers of process formalization. Vázquez Noguera et al. (2024) described program improvements associated with accreditation processes, including governance and resource management enhancements. Although the study is not centered on a faculty portfolio software artifact, it supports the institutional rationale for systems that generate structured evidence and improve policy compliance consistency.

Fernando-Raguro et al. (2021) similarly emphasized governance readiness in smart university transformation, highlighting the need for structured technology management at institutional level. Ozeki et al. (2021), in abstract-only evidence, also underscored that educational data management is an essential component of quality teaching systems. Sudha et al. (2025), another abstract-only study, suggested that automated analytics and dashboard reporting can improve transparency and strategic planning in academic settings.

Taken together, these studies support the governance relevance of FPMS development: institutions need systems that do not merely store files but also structure responsibilities, track process states, and produce reliable evidence for internal and external quality requirements.

### Theme 4: Information and Records Management Behavior in HEI Systems
Evidence from information management studies indicates that user behavior in maintaining institutional records affects system outcomes. Lee et al. (2023), using a large-scale log-based analysis of research information management system activity, identified distinct user behavior clusters related to profile completeness and visibility management. Their findings show that completeness-related actions are behaviorally patterned and can be influenced by role, career stage, and institutional context. This has direct design implications for FPMS: compliance-oriented systems should not assume uniform behavior and should instead provide guided workflows, reminders, and role-specific affordances to improve completion outcomes.

Ikwunne et al. (2021) also demonstrated that role-based architecture can be implemented effectively in web systems, though their setting was collaborative learning rather than faculty compliance documentation. Even when domain transfer is partial, this study supports a broader systems principle relevant to FPMS: controlled access pathways and clearly separated functions are foundational to scalable institutional operations.

### Theme 5: Methodological Patterns and Evidence Quality
Methodologically, the reviewed studies show a dominance of design-and-development reports, descriptive analyses, and conceptual frameworks, with fewer studies offering robust comparative or inferential evaluation. Among full-text studies, Reyes et al. (2023) provides one of the stronger operational evaluations through SUS and technical test metrics. Several other studies report meaningful outcomes but rely primarily on descriptive interpretation, while reliability measures (e.g., Cronbach's alpha) and inferential statistics are often absent or not fully reported.

The inclusion of eight abstract-only studies broadens thematic coverage but introduces unavoidable evidence limitations: sample designs, instrument validity, statistical treatment, and detailed results are frequently unavailable at abstract level. For this reason, the current synthesis treats full-text studies as primary evidence and abstract-only studies as contextual trend indicators.

This methodological profile also clarifies an opportunity for the present FPMS research: by combining artifact development with measurable operational outcomes (such as required-document completeness and processing-duration indicators), usability/acceptance evaluation, and transparent statistical reporting, the study can contribute stronger empirical rigor than many currently available system-development papers. Review-turnaround and action-level governance metrics should be reported when corresponding review and audit records are available in the evaluation dataset.

### Synthesis and Research Gap
Across themes, existing literature confirms that higher education institutions benefit from digital systems for faculty-related management, portfolio support, and quality assurance alignment. However, a specific gap remains: relatively few studies demonstrate a unified, deployable, role-based faculty portfolio system that simultaneously handles required-document completeness enforcement, structured review decision flow, and audit-ready evidence generation. Many available studies either focus on appraisal analytics, conceptual e-portfolio architecture, or broad institutional frameworks without delivering integrated compliance workflow metrics.

In addition, operational indicators central to this study, particularly mandatory-document completeness rates and reviewer-turnaround indicators, are inconsistently reported in prior work. Usability and acceptance evidence is present but uneven, and reliability reporting is often limited. These gaps justify the present study’s focus on developing and evaluating a web-based Faculty Portfolio Management System that combines workflow automation, governance controls, and evidence-oriented reporting under one institutional platform, with transparent notation of indicators that are not measurable in a given extraction window.

### Chapter Summary
This chapter reviewed related literature through five thematic lenses and established both the relevance and limitations of current evidence for FPMS research. The synthesis showed strong support for digital workflow transformation and governance-oriented systems in higher education, while also identifying unresolved gaps in integrated compliance operations and metric completeness. These findings provide the conceptual and empirical basis for the methodology presented in Chapter III, where the FPMS artifact and its evaluation framework are operationalized using available records and explicit data-availability reporting.

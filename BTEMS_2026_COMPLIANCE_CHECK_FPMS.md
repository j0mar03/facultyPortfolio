# BTEMS 2026 Compliance Check - FPMS Manuscript

## Submission Context
Target event: **BTEMS 2026** (International Conference on Advanced Business, Technology, Engineering, and Medical Solutions)

Theme alignment target: multidisciplinary innovation for sustainable future.

Manuscript set reviewed:
- `PUBLISHABLE_PAPER_DRAFT_FACULTY_PORTFOLIO.md`
- `CHAPTER_II_NARRATIVE_DRAFT_FACULTY_PORTFOLIO.md`
- `CHAPTER_III_DRAFT_FACULTY_PORTFOLIO.md`
- `CHAPTER_I_DRAFT_FACULTY_PORTFOLIO.md`

## A. Track Fit Assessment

### A1. Fit with BTEMS Tracks
- **Technology & Engineering:** **Strong fit** (information systems, web-based workflow, governance controls).
- **Business & Economics:** **Moderate fit** (process efficiency, administrative management, compliance operations).
- **Medical & Health Sciences:** **Low/conditional fit** unless your institution/context is explicitly medical.

### A2. Recommended Track Label
Use: **Technology & Engineering (Information Systems / Business Informatics)**.

Optional secondary framing: **Business process and governance optimization in higher education**.

## B. Problem-Method-Result Alignment Check

### B1. Statement of the Problem Alignment
Status: **Pass (structure-level)**

Your SOP variables are coherent and measurable:
1. Workflow improvement
2. Completeness support
3. Turnaround support
4. Usability/acceptance
5. Governance/traceability

### B2. Method Alignment
Status: **Pass (design-level), Conditional (execution-level)**

Chapter III design and instrumentation are aligned with SOP, including:
- system log extraction,
- SUS + TAM questionnaire,
- descriptive/inferential statistics,
- reliability checks.

### B3. Results Alignment
Status: **Pending / Critical for acceptance strength**

Your manuscript still needs fully populated results tables with real values for:
- processing time,
- review turnaround,
- completeness rates,
- SUS and TAM means,
- Cronbach’s alpha,
- test statistics and p-values (if run).

Without this, acceptance probability drops because reviewers may treat it as a proposal/system description instead of completed research.

## D. Estimated Acceptance Readiness (Practical)

Current status (with drafts but no final results): **Moderate-Low**

Projected status after completing results + formatting + plagiarism check: **Moderate-High**

Primary factors that will influence acceptance:
1. Completion and clarity of empirical results.
2. Tight link between SOP questions and reported findings.
3. Manuscript formatting compliance with conference template.
4. Similarity index compliance and citation quality.

---

## E. High-Priority Revisions Before Submission

1. Populate all placeholder tables in `PUBLISHABLE_PAPER_DRAFT_FACULTY_PORTFOLIO.md`.
2. Add a short “Baseline Definition” subsection in Chapter III (what counts as pre-implementation data).
3. Add exact respondent counts and evaluation period dates.
4. Report Cronbach’s alpha for WI, CS, RT, GT, PU, PEOU, BI.
5. Add inferential test outputs (or justify descriptive-only if sample constraints apply).
6. Write a results-driven abstract (include at least 3 numeric findings).
7. Run Turnitin/similarity check and revise paraphrasing before final upload.

---

## F. Suggested BTEMS Abstract Pattern (Final Version)

Use this 5-part structure:
1. Problem context (manual/fragmented faculty portfolio process)
2. Artifact (role-based FPMS)
3. Method (design-and-development + quantitative evaluation)
4. Key numeric findings (time/completeness/SUS/TAM)
5. Contribution (governance-ready digital compliance workflow)

---

## G. Final Compliance Verdict

**Aligned with BTEMS 2026 scope:** **Yes**

**Submission-ready today:** **Not yet** (results and formatting still incomplete)

**Can be made submission-ready:** **Yes**, after completing the high-priority revisions listed in Section E.

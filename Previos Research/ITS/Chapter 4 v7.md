# **RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

This chapter presents, interprets, and analyzes the data retrieved from evaluating the Math Tagumpay Bayesian-Fuzzy Hybrid Intelligent Tutoring System for Grade 3-4 mathematics in the Philippines through survey questionnaires administered to 10 Grade 3-4 mathematics teachers from elementary schools in Bataan Province over a 2-week implementation period. The results are organized according to the research questions outlined in Chapter 1, followed by comprehensive discussion connecting findings to existing literature and broader academic implications.

## System Performance of the Developed Bayesian-Fuzzy Hybrid Intelligent Tutoring System

This section addresses Research Question 1: "What is the level of agreement of the respondents of the developed Bayesian with Fuzzy logic Intelligent Tutoring System for Grade 3-4 mathematics in the Philippines, as measured by System Accuracy and System Timeliness?"

The level of agreement is interpreted based on the five-point Likert scale established in Chapter 3, where ratings are categorized as: Strongly Agree (4.21-5.00), Agree (3.41-4.20), Neutral (2.61-3.40), Disagree (1.81-2.60), and Strongly Disagree (1.00-1.80).

### System Accuracy Assessment Results

Table 1 demonstrates exceptional system accuracy performance across all evaluated dimensions. The highest rating was achieved for mathematical content generation and solution correctness (M = 4.60), representing a 92% positive response rate with 6 teachers strongly agreeing and 4 teachers agreeing. This finding aligns with contemporary research by Kumar et al. (2020), who established that sophisticated Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid architectures achieve content accuracy rates between 91-95%, validating the technical excellence of the Math Tagumpay system.

The assessment feedback accuracy achieved a weighted mean of 4.40 with 100% positive response rate from all participating teachers, supporting VanLehn's (2011) assertion that effective intelligent tutoring systems must provide accurate, contextually appropriate feedback to maintain educational effectiveness. The consistency in high ratings across knowledge identification (M = 4.20) and content recommendation appropriateness (M = 4.20) with 90% positive response rates each, confirms Chen et al.'s (2018) findings that hybrid AI systems demonstrate superior performance in student modeling and adaptive content delivery compared to single-algorithm approaches.

The overall system accuracy achieved a weighted mean of 4.30, representing a 94% positive response rate across all accuracy dimensions. This performance exceeds the 85% accuracy threshold established by Piech et al. (2015) for effective educational AI systems and validates Li et al.'s (2019) research demonstrating that elementary mathematics-focused hybrid systems can achieve knowledge state prediction accuracy of 85-91% in real-world educational contexts.

### System Timeliness Assessment Results

**Table 2. Level of Agreement on System Timeliness of the Math Tagumpay System**

| **Overall Perceived Usefulness**                                    | **4.22**      | **Highly Acceptable** |

Table 3 demonstrates strong perceived usefulness across all evaluated dimensions. The teaching effectiveness enhancement achieved the highest rating (M = 4.50, SD = 0.53) with 100% positive response rate, supporting Scherer et al.'s (2019) meta-analytical findings that educational AI systems require perceived usefulness scores ≥4.3 on 5-point scales to achieve sustainable adoption rates. This result validates Davis's (1989) foundational TAM research demonstrating that perceived usefulness serves as the primary determinant of technology acceptance in educational contexts.

The teaching performance improvement indicator achieved a weighted mean of 4.40 (SD = 0.52) with 100% positive response rate, aligning with Al-Rahmi et al.'s (2019) research showing that culturally adapted educational technologies achieve 25-40% higher acceptance rates compared to generic systems. The personalized learning support recognition (M = 4.20, SD = 0.63) with 100% positive response confirms VanLehn's (2011) assertion that intelligent tutoring systems' primary value lies in their ability to provide individualized instruction that adapts to learner needs.

The overall perceived usefulness achieved a weighted mean of 4.22 (SD = 0.64), representing a 95% positive response rate. This performance exceeds the acceptance thresholds established by Rodriguez-Ardura and Meseguer-Artola (2019) for sustainable ITS adoption and validates the cultural adaptation framework's effectiveness in enhancing user acceptance among Filipino educators, as predicted by Bernardo's (2017) research on Philippine educational technology preferences.

### Perceived Ease of Use Assessment Results

**Table 4. Level of Acceptance on Perceived Ease of Use of the Math Tagumpay System**

| Indicator                                                            | Weighted Mean | Level of Acceptance |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Learning to operate AI tutoring systems would be easy for me         | 3.70          | Acceptable          |

However, this study extends beyond traditional BKT applications by demonstrating that sequential processing—where BKT outputs serve as inputs to fuzzy logic systems—achieves superior performance compared to parallel hybrid approaches documented in existing literature.

The mathematical content generation accuracy (M = 4.60) significantly exceeds the 85-95% accuracy ranges reported by Piech et al. (2015) for deep knowledge tracing systems, suggesting that the sequential architecture's two-stage refinement process provides enhanced precision in educational content delivery. This finding supports Chen et al.'s (2018) theoretical predictions about hybrid system superiority while demonstrating practical implementation success in real-world educational settings.

The system timeliness performance (M = 4.20, 94% positive response) validates Kumar et al.'s (2018) research on optimized inference engines while extending their findings to elementary mathematics contexts. The immediate feedback provision excellence (M = 4.50) confirms UNESCO's (2012) theoretical framework regarding eLearning effectiveness, demonstrating that sophisticated AI systems can maintain the responsiveness essential for young learners' engagement.

### Cultural Adaptation Framework Validation and Societal Implications

The Technology Acceptance Model results provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the cultural adaptation framework developed for this study. The exceptional attitude toward using scores (M = 4.26, 98% positive response) validate Bernardo's (2017) research on Filipino learning preferences while extending TAM theory to sophisticated AI educational systems in developing country contexts.

This achievement has significant implications for educational equity, as it demonstrates that sophisticated educational technologies can be successfully adapted for diverse cultural contexts without compromising technical excellence.

The moderate perceived ease of use scores (M = 3.68, 68% positive response) align with Teo's (2012) research on technology acceptance barriers while highlighting opportunities for enhanced teacher training and interface optimization. This finding suggests that while technical sophistication is achievable, sustained implementation success requires comprehensive professional development programs, supporting Venkatesh et al.'s (2021) UTAUT3 framework predictions.

### Sequential Processing Innovation and Theoretical Advancement

The overall system performance (M = 4.18, 89.5% positive response) provides the first empirical validation of sequential BKT→Fuzzy processing in educational contexts. This represents a significant theoretical advancement beyond existing parallel hybrid approaches documented by Li et al. (2019) and Zhang and Wang (2020). The sequential architecture's success in achieving both high accuracy and strong user acceptance demonstrates that educational AI innovation can simultaneously advance technical capabilities and practical implementation success.

The behavioral intention results (M = 3.98, 88% positive response) indicate strong potential for sustained adoption, validating Davis's (1989) TAM framework while extending its application to sophisticated hybrid AI systems. This finding suggests that the sequential processing approach offers practical advantages that translate into user acceptance, supporting the theoretical proposition that architectural innovation can enhance both technical performance and user experience.

### Study Limitations and Considerations

While the results demonstrate strong system performance and user acceptance, several limitations must be acknowledged that may influence the interpretation and generalizability of findings.

**Methodological Limitations**: The study's two-week implementation period, while sufficient for initial evaluation, may not capture long-term usage patterns, seasonal variations in system performance, or evolving user attitudes over extended implementation periods. Future research should examine sustained implementation outcomes over academic terms or full school years to validate long-term effectiveness and acceptance.

The sample size of ten Grade 3-4 mathematics teachers, while appropriate for intensive case study methodology, limits generalizability across diverse Philippine educational contexts. Geographic limitation to Bataan Province may not represent all regional variations in infrastructure, cultural contexts, or educational practices present throughout the Philippines.

**Technical Limitations**: The study focused on system performance evaluation and user acceptance rather than measuring actual student learning outcomes or academic achievement improvements. While the technical excellence and teacher acceptance provide strong indicators of educational potential, direct learning impact assessment requires longitudinal student performance studies beyond this research scope.

The evaluation concentrated on the system's technical performance and user acceptance within specific Grade 3-4 mathematics curriculum areas, potentially limiting generalizability to other elementary subjects, grade levels, or educational domains requiring different pedagogical approaches or content structures.

**Cultural and Contextual Limitations**: Although the study achieved 100% cultural acceptance among participating teachers, the research context in Bataan Province may not represent all cultural, linguistic, or socioeconomic variations present across the diverse Philippine educational landscape. Implementation in different regions, language contexts, or institutional settings may require additional cultural adaptation considerations.

The focus on teacher perspectives, while crucial for implementation success, does not fully capture parent, administrator, or student perspectives that may influence long-term adoption and effectiveness. Comprehensive stakeholder evaluation would provide more complete understanding of system acceptance and implementation requirements.

### Directions for Future Research

Based on the study's findings and identified limitations, several important directions for future research emerge that would advance understanding of educational AI implementation and effectiveness.

**Longitudinal Implementation Studies**: Future research should examine sustained implementation outcomes over complete academic terms or multiple school years to validate long-term effectiveness, user satisfaction, and system performance. Longitudinal studies would provide insights into adaptation patterns, evolving user attitudes, and technical performance stability over extended periods.

Investigation of student learning outcome impacts through comprehensive pre-post academic achievement assessment would provide direct evidence of educational effectiveness beyond technical performance and user acceptance measures. Such studies should examine both immediate learning gains and long-term academic progression effects.

**Expanded Geographic and Cultural Contexts**: Research extending the cultural adaptation framework to other Philippine regions, languages, and socioeconomic contexts would validate the generalizability of the approach and identify additional cultural factors influencing educational AI acceptance and effectiveness.

Comparative studies implementing the sequential BKT→Fuzzy approach in other developing countries with similar infrastructure constraints and cultural characteristics would test the international applicability of the cultural adaptation framework and technical architecture.

**Technical Innovation and Enhancement**: Future research should explore expanding the sequential processing approach to other elementary subjects beyond mathematics, investigating the architecture's effectiveness across diverse educational domains and content types.

Investigation of enhanced user interface design and training program development based on the perceived ease of use findings would provide practical guidance for optimizing system usability and adoption success.

**Comprehensive Stakeholder Research**: Studies incorporating parent, administrator, and student perspectives alongside teacher evaluations would provide complete stakeholder acceptance assessment and identify factors influencing comprehensive implementation success.

Research examining institutional factors, policy frameworks, and professional development approaches supporting successful educational AI implementation would provide practical guidance for scaling innovative educational technologies.

The study's contributions to educational AI theory, technology acceptance research, and practical implementation guidance establish important foundations for future research and development efforts. The demonstrated success in achieving both technical excellence and cultural acceptance provides compelling evidence that sophisticated educational AI can serve diverse learners effectively while honoring local educational contexts and values.

The research confirms that the future of elementary mathematics education lies not in choosing between traditional instruction and artificial intelligence, but in thoughtfully combining both to create learning experiences that are more personalized, adaptive, and effective than either could achieve alone. The Math Tagumpay system validates this vision while providing practical pathways for realizing enhanced educational possibilities that serve all learners effectively.

# **THE PROBLEM AND ITS SETTING**

## Introduction

This research into early childhood education and digital learning began with a simple yet profound realization: traditional pedagogical approaches, while grounded in decades of research, struggle to meet the diverse and complex needs of today's young learners. The research landscape reveals sobering realities about challenges in early childhood education. Estrada, Marcelo, Corpuz, and Antonio (2017) emphasized that "early childhood education affects a child's holistic development into adulthood," highlighting the critical importance of addressing gaps between existing programs and children's actual developmental needs.

The global educational technology revolution has positioned Intelligent Tutoring Systems as transformative tools for personalized learning. VanLehn (2011) established ITS as key educational technologies that fundamentally reshape student-content interactions, while UNESCO's (2012) comprehensive analysis revealed digital learning's transformative potential. Their findings that effective eLearning could help students "develop the skills they—and their countries—need to thrive in the 21st century" suggest that thoughtfully implemented digital learning tools provide advantages extending far beyond immediate academic achievement.

However, exploration of curriculum development research revealed the critical importance of maintaining developmental appropriateness in any technological intervention. Corpuz, Cruz, Baston, del Socorro, and Hidalgo (2016) emphasized that effective curricula must "reflect current research on child development" and maintain "a balance of play and structured activities, teacher-initiated and child-initiated exploration." Their reinforcement of Jean Piaget's philosophy that "play meets the physical, intellectual, language, emotional, and social needs (PILES) of children" became a cornerstone of understanding that successful educational technology must harness rather than constrain children's natural learning processes.

The breakthrough came when research revealed Drigas and Kokkilia's finding that "kindergarteners can benefit from the use of new technology and can gain many advantages using the appropriate educational tools that ICT offers." Particularly significant was their emphasis that teachers remain "significant and demand elaboration and clarification, especially when ICT is incorporated with traditional teaching methods." This finding reinforced the critical principle that technology must enhance rather than replace human relationships in early learning environments.

However, the global enthusiasm for educational technology innovation contrasts sharply with the realities faced by developing countries, particularly in the Philippines. The Department of Education (DepEd, 2023) reported that 82% of Grade 4 students fall below minimum mathematics proficiency levels, creating an urgent need for innovative instructional approaches. This educational crisis becomes more complex when considered alongside infrastructure limitations, including intermittent connectivity and limited technological resources that characterize many Philippine educational contexts.

The juxtaposition of global technological possibilities with local educational realities establishes the central tension that drives this research: how can sophisticated educational AI be adapted to serve learners in resource-constrained environments while maintaining both technical excellence and cultural appropriateness? This question becomes particularly critical when examining the specific challenges of elementary mathematics education, where foundational concepts must be mastered to ensure future academic success.

My research took a significant turn when I encountered intelligent learning systems that could adapt to individual learners' needs. This discovery prompted investigation into Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT), a probabilistic framework introduced by Corbett and Anderson (1994) that has significantly influenced how educational technologies model student learning. BKT operates using four key parameters to track knowledge states and has particular strength in managing uncertainty. Recent advances have demonstrated its effectiveness: Piech et al. (2015) reported prediction accuracies ranging from 85% to 95%, while Nagatani et al. (2019) achieved 88% to 94% accuracy in mathematics education.

However, a critical gap remains: the majority of BKT research has focused on older learners, leaving early childhood education largely unexplored. To address this limitation, researchers have explored fuzzy logic, originally proposed by Zadeh (1965), which offers the ability to reason about partial knowledge and near-correct responses. This approach aligns well with the developmental characteristics of young learners because binary assessments often fail to capture their emerging understanding. Chrysafiadi and Virvou (2013) introduced neuro-fuzzy systems that achieved inference accuracies between 92% and 96%, while Hwang and Chang (2011) demonstrated that fuzzy-based educational systems significantly outperformed traditional methods.

The convergence of research on BKT and fuzzy logic led to an important realization: neither BKT nor fuzzy logic alone could fully address the complexity of early childhood learning. This insight directed investigation toward hybrid AI approaches that combined temporal knowledge modeling with uncertainty handling. Chen et al. (2018) developed Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid architectures demonstrating 15–25% higher effectiveness compared to single-algorithm implementations. Li et al. (2019) conducted specialized research on hybrid AI for elementary mathematics education that achieved 85–91% knowledge state prediction accuracy, 88–94% intervention recommendation precision, and 2.8-second average response times.

## Theoretical Framework

The Input-Process-Output Model of General System Theory is incorporated in the development of Math Tagumpay Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid Intelligent Tutoring System for Grade 3-4 mathematics education with personalized learning for Philippine contexts. In this study, the inputs are challenges faced by grade 3-4 mathematics teachers in providing personalized instruction and tracking student progress, along with measurement requirements for system performance evaluation including level of agreement on System Accuracy, level of agreement on System Timeliness, and user acceptance level based on Technology Acceptance Model constructs.

These inputs inform the development of the Math Tagumpay Bayesian with Fuzzy Logic Intelligent Tutoring System. A 2-week evaluation with 10 teachers is conducted using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) survey methodology to measure the levels of agreement and user acceptance. The gathered data are analyzed and converted into information that serves as the basis for system validation and recommendations. Through this process, the data are converted into the final output: the developed Math Tagumpay Bayesian with Fuzzy Logic Intelligent Tutoring System.

The framework is based on the foundational principles of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) architecture, specifically the Three Models Framework. This framework provides a structured approach to understanding the essential components required for implementing effective educational AI systems through three interconnected models: the Expert Model, Student Model, and Tutor Model, each serving distinct but interconnected functions.

The Expert Model defines the ideal knowledge and skills that learners should acquire within the educational domain. In this study, the Expert Model encompasses early childhood mathematics curriculum standards, developmental learning progressions, appropriate pedagogical strategies for young learners, correct problem-solving procedures, and common misconceptions and errors typical in early childhood learning.

The Student Model is the system's dynamic representation of individual learner characteristics, knowledge states, and learning progressions. In this research, the Student Model is implemented through sophisticated hybrid Bayesian-fuzzy algorithms that track each child's mathematical understanding, learning preferences, attention patterns, response characteristics, and developmental progress over time.

The Tutor Model is the pedagogical reasoning component that determines appropriate instructional strategies, content selection, and intervention timing based on the interactions between the Expert Model and Student Model. In this study, the Tutor Model integrates AI-driven decision-making with developmentally appropriate early childhood education practices.

## Statement of the Problem

This study centers on the development and evaluation of a Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid ITS for third- and fourth-grade mathematics in the Philippines, ensuring the system is effective in real-world educational settings and addressing the needs of Filipino third- and fourth-grade students in diverse learning environments. Although acknowledging the broader aspirations of Intelligent Tutoring Systems to enhance student engagement and deliver timely interventions, this research strategically prioritizes the essential step of evaluating the accuracy and timeliness of instructional interventions and user acceptance of the newly developed system. To address this critical need, this study seeks to address the following research questions:

1. What is the level of agreement of the respondents of the developed Bayesian with Fuzzy logic Intelligent Tutoring System for Grade 3-4 mathematics in the Philippines, as measured by:

1.1 System Accuracy

1.2 System Timeliness

2. What is the level of user acceptance of the developed Bayesian with Fuzzy logic among Grade 3-4 students and teachers in the Philippines, as assessed by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), focusing on:

2.1 Perceived Usefulness

2.2 Perceived Ease of Use

2.3 Attitude Towards Using

2.4 Behavioral Intention to Use

## Scope and Limitations of the Study

This study focuses on mathematics teachers who instruct Grade 3 and 4 students, typically aged 8 to 10, in selected elementary schools in the Philippines. The study involves evaluating the Math Tagumpay Bayesian with Fuzzy Hybrid Intelligent Tutoring System. The subject matter centers on the mathematics curriculum for Grades 3 and 4, ensuring alignment with Philippine educational standards and DepEd requirements.

The technological scope encompasses an Intelligent Tutoring System that integrates Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and a Fuzzy Inference System to enhance personalized learning. The platform operates online through web browsers at http://www.mathtagumpay.xyz, accessible via desktop or mobile devices. The system serves three user types: (1) administrators, (2) teachers, and (3) students, each with specific functionalities for account management, question modification, student monitoring, and assessment delivery.

Key assessment areas include measuring levels of agreement on system accuracy and timeliness, evaluating user acceptance through Technology Acceptance Model constructs (Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Attitude Towards Using, and Behavioral Intention to Use), and analyzing the system's effectiveness in providing personalized interventions and supporting teaching practices.

This study limits its scope to a two-week evaluation period with 10 Grade 3 and Grade 4 mathematics teachers, which may not capture long-term usage patterns or seasonal variations in system performance. The research focuses specifically on system performance evaluation and user acceptance rather than measuring actual student learning outcomes or academic achievement improvements. The study does not include parent accounts or parental perspectives due to the supervision requirements of the target age group. Geographic coverage is limited to selected schools in Bataan Province, which may not represent all Philippine educational contexts.

# **RESEARCH METHODOLOGY**

This chapter describes and presents the method of research, the population, sample size, sampling technique, description of respondents, instrumentation, data-gathering procedure, and statistical treatment.

## Research Design

This study employs a descriptive research method to develop and evaluate a Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid Intelligent Tutoring System for Grade 3-4 mathematics in the Philippines. The system requires evaluation and description according to established educational technology standards. This aligns with Dulock's (1993) definition of descriptive research as a method used to systematically and accurately describe the facts and characteristics of a given area of interest or population. Because this study uses numerical representation to evaluate acceptability levels, system performance (accuracy and timeliness), and user acceptance variables through Likert scale assessments, a quantitative research approach is most suitable. According to Babbie (2010), the quantitative research approach emphasizes objective measurements and uses statistical, mathematical, or numerical analysis of data collected through polls, questionnaires, and surveys.

The descriptive approach is particularly appropriate because this study focuses on developing and evaluating a Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid ITS specifically for Grades 3-4 mathematics education in the Philippines. This approach ensures the system's effectiveness in real-world educational settings while addressing the specific learning needs of Filipino students in Grades 3-4 across diverse educational environments. This methodology enables comprehensive assessment of system performance metrics (accuracy and timeliness) and user acceptance indicators while maintaining objectivity in evaluating intelligent tutoring systems within Philippine educational contexts.

## Sources of Data

This research utilizes multiple sources of data classified according to their proximity to the original research and their role in supporting the study's objectives.

**Primary Sources** consist of original research materials including foundational research articles on Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (Corbett & Anderson, 1994; Piech et al., 2015; Nagatani et al., 2019), original studies on fuzzy logic in educational systems (Chrysafiadi & Virvou, 2013; Hwang & Chang, 2011), contemporary research on hybrid AI approaches in education (Chen et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019; Zhang & Wang, 2020), Technology Acceptance Model studies specifically related to educational AI systems (Scherer et al., 2019; Al-Rahmi et al., 2019), original data collected from the 10 Grade 3-4 mathematics teachers participating in the system evaluation, and system performance metrics automatically logged during the 2-week implementation period.

**Secondary Sources** provide scholarly summaries and contextual information including review papers on Intelligent Tutoring Systems effectiveness (VanLehn, 2011; Graesser et al., 2012), educational technology anthologies discussing AI applications in developing countries, textbooks on educational psychology and learning theory relevant to elementary mathematics education, meta-analytical studies of technology acceptance in educational contexts (Cabanillas et al., 2020), Philippine educational policy documents from the Department of Education (DepEd, 2023), and UNESCO reports on educational technology implementation in developing countries (UNESCO, 2012).

**General Sources** provide contextual information including educational technology magazine articles discussing current trends in AI-enhanced learning, Philippine newspaper reports on mathematics education challenges and technology initiatives, conference proceedings from educational technology and artificial intelligence conferences, government statistics on educational performance and technology infrastructure in the Philippines, and international comparative studies on mathematics education performance (OECD, 2019).

## Research Instrument

The instrument used is a researcher-developed survey questionnaire designed to measure multiple variables related to the Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid Intelligent Tutoring System for Grade 3-4 mathematics in the Philippines. The questionnaire measures the following key variables: system performance of the developed Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid ITS in terms of accuracy and timeliness, and level of user acceptance of the developed system as assessed by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) focusing on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude towards using, and behavioral intention to use.

**System Performance Evaluation** measures the technical effectiveness through two key constructs: System Accuracy Assessment (adapted from Wagner, 2013; Behkamal et al., 2009; Martín-García et al., 2019) includes five indicators covering mathematical content generation and solution correctness, student knowledge level identification precision, content recommendation appropriateness, struggle detection accuracy, and assessment feedback quality and appropriateness. System Timeliness Assessment (adapted from Learning Management Systems Effectiveness Questionnaire with Cronbach's α = 0.963) includes five indicators covering immediate feedback provision speed, adaptive content delivery responsiveness, intervention response time efficiency, learning flow maintenance without interruption, and real-time monitoring data update promptness.

**User Acceptance Evaluation** employs the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) framework (Davis, 1989) adapted for educational AI systems (Guo, Shi & Zhai, 2024) with four validated constructs: Perceived Usefulness (6 items) measures teachers' subjective assessment of the degree to which using the ITS would enhance their teaching performance and effectiveness. Perceived Ease of Use (5 items) evaluates teachers' perception of the effort required to interact with and operate the AI tutoring system. Attitude Toward Using (5 items) assesses teachers' overall favorability and positive disposition toward implementing the ITS in their mathematics instruction. Behavioral Intention to Use (5 items) measures teachers' commitment to future adoption and recommendation of the system to colleagues.

The researcher employed a Likert scale to measure teacher perceptions of the Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid Intelligent Tutoring System. A Likert scale is a psychometric response scale widely used in educational research questionnaires and survey instruments. When responding to Likert questionnaire items, respondents specify their level of agreement with statements about system performance and acceptance. The researcher used a five-point scale, with five representing the highest positive response and one representing the lowest.

| Rating | Numerical Scale | Verbal Interpretation | Level of Acceptance   |
| ------ | --------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| 5      | 4.21 – 5.00     | Strongly Agree        | Highly Acceptable     |
| 4      | 3.41 – 4.20     | Agree                 | Acceptable            |
| 3      | 2.61 – 3.40     | Neutral               | Moderately Acceptable |
| 2      | 1.81 – 2.60     | Disagree              | Slightly Acceptable   |
| 1      | 1.00 – 1.80     | Strongly Disagree     | Not Acceptable        |

Furthermore, specialized evaluation criteria for intelligent tutoring systems were incorporated into this study as assessment instruments. The evaluation framework defines system effectiveness in terms of accuracy and timeliness metrics that directly impact learning effectiveness in Grade 3-4 mathematics instruction. Additionally, automated system performance monitoring serves as a secondary instrument, collecting real-time data on response times, accuracy rates, and user interaction patterns during the implementation period.

## Data Generation Procedure

For careful analysis of data, the researcher used the following statistical procedures and systematic approach to collect comprehensive information about system performance and user acceptance through multiple measurement strategies.

**Phase 1: Participant Recruitment and Orientation** involved selecting ten Grade 3-4 mathematics teachers from elementary schools in Bataan Province using purposive and convenience sampling methods. According to Black (2010), purposive sampling occurs when elements selected for the sample are chosen by the judgment of the researcher based on specific criteria including current Grade 3-4 mathematics teaching assignment, basic computer literacy, and institutional technology infrastructure capability. Selected participants received comprehensive orientation sessions covering system functionality, evaluation procedures, and ethical considerations.

**Phase 2: System Implementation and Data Collection** included a two-week intensive implementation period, allowing sufficient time for teachers to experience the full range of system capabilities while maintaining manageable evaluation scope. Multiple data collection strategies were employed: automated performance logging where the system continuously recorded performance metrics including response times, accuracy rates, intervention frequencies, and user interaction patterns; structured survey administration where the comprehensive questionnaire was administered at the conclusion of the implementation period; and expert validation where mathematics education specialists provided independent assessment of content accuracy and pedagogical appropriateness.

**Phase 3: Data Quality Assurance** involved response validation where all survey responses were checked for completeness and consistency, performance data verification where automated logs were cross-validated with teacher reports, and missing data management with comprehensive protocols to minimize incomplete responses.

**Percentage** - The quotient will divide 100 to exchange the quotient to percentage (%).

Formula: P = (n/N) × 100

Where: P=Percentage, n=Frequency, N=Population size

A frequency distribution provides an organized tabulation or graphical representation of the number of individuals in each category on the scale of measurement. It allows the researcher to conveniently have a comprehensive view of the entire dataset, showing whether the observations are high or low and whether they are concentrated in one area or spread out across the entire scale.

**Weighted mean calculations** consider the relative importance or frequency of each response category, providing a more accurate representation of central tendency when dealing with Likert-scale responses. This measure is particularly useful for analyzing TAM survey responses, where different response categories carry varying weights in determining overall user acceptance levels.

**Positive Response Rate Calculation** combines "Agree" and "Strongly Agree" responses as percentage of total responses, providing clear indicators of system acceptance and performance effectiveness.

These statistical measures collectively enable comprehensive analysis of the collected data, facilitating accurate interpretation of system performance levels and user acceptance ratings that are essential for validating the Math Tagumpay Bayesian with Fuzzy Intelligent Tutoring System.

## Ethical Considerations

This study prioritizes human subjects' protection and compliance by securing Ethical Research approval from the PUP University Research Ethics Committee (UREC). This involves a comprehensive protocol submission detailing all instruments, consent forms, and risk assessments, ensuring alignment with both Philippine and international ethics standards. A thorough risk assessment identified minimal risks, documented mitigation strategies, and ensured the positive outcomes of this research are deemed to outweigh possible adverse effects to students, teachers, and parents.

**Informed consent and assent procedures** are critical: teachers received full documentation and confirmed voluntary participation with the right to withdraw, while written parental consent was obtained for all minor students (under 18). For Grade 3-4 students (ages 8-10), age-appropriate assent forms were used to ensure participants are fully informed of the voluntary nature of their involvement.

**Data Privacy and Confidentiality Protection** treated data privacy and confidentiality with the highest level of importance, with strict adherence to COPPA and FERPA compliance. This means implementing strict data collection limitations for users under 13, securing parental consent for all minor participants' data, and minimizing data collection to only educationally necessary information. All educational records and student performance data were protected, with data sharing agreements complying with FERPA requirements. For data security and anonymization, end-to-end encryption was used for all data transmission and storage, with access limited to authorized personnel through secure, password-protected databases and role-based controls. To protect participant identities, unique research IDs replaced personally identifiable information, and all direct identifiers were removed or encrypted to prevent re-identification.

**Data Retention and Disposal** involved clear data retention periods defined and adhered to, aligning with research and regulatory guidelines. Data was only maintained as long as necessary for research and follow-up analysis, with secure deletion procedures for all electronic data and complete destruction of physical documents at the end of the retention period. The study also considered long-term data stewardship by preserving anonymized datasets for future educational research, ensuring complete anonymization and broader educational benefit, with clear governance procedures for any future data sharing.

## Data Case Analysis

The data case analysis for the Math Tagumpay Bayesian-Fuzzy Hybrid Intelligent Tutoring System evaluation involved comprehensive examination of survey responses from ten Grade 3-4 mathematics teachers who participated in the 2-week implementation study. The analysis employed descriptive statistical methods to evaluate system performance across three primary dimensions: system accuracy, system timeliness, and technology acceptance using the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Each survey response was coded using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree (5), with weighted means calculated for individual indicators and overall construct evaluation.

The data analysis process included calculation of weighted means, standard deviations, and positive response rates for each evaluation dimension. System accuracy assessment examined mathematical content correctness, student knowledge identification, content recommendation appropriateness, struggle detection precision, and assessment feedback accuracy. System timeliness evaluation focused on immediate feedback provision, adaptive content delivery speed, intervention response time, loading performance, and real-time monitoring updates. Technology acceptance analysis encompassed perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude toward using, and behavioral intention to use constructs as defined by the TAM framework.

Statistical interpretation followed established academic conventions where weighted means of 4.50-5.00 indicated "Strongly Agree," 3.50-4.49 represented "Agree," 2.50-3.49 signified "Neutral," 1.50-2.49 meant "Disagree," and 1.00-1.49 indicated "Strongly Disagree." Positive response rates were calculated by combining "Agree" and "Strongly Agree" responses as a percentage of total responses, providing clear indicators of system acceptance and performance effectiveness. The comprehensive data analysis revealed overall system evaluation achieving 4.18 weighted mean with 89.5% positive response rate, validating the effectiveness of the Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid approach for Grade 3-4 mathematics education in Philippine educational contexts.

## Software Development

Using the Design-Based Research (DBR) methodology, this study followed the principles of analysis, design, and evaluation to develop the Math Tagumpay Bayesian-Fuzzy Hybrid Intelligent Tutoring System. The research procedure was divided into three stages: Analysis stage includes interviews with Grade 3-4 mathematics teachers to identify problems in teaching mathematics concepts to young learners. Key issues identified include difficulty in providing personalized instruction, tracking individual student progress, and providing timely interventions for students who struggle with mathematical concepts. Design and implementation stage involved the development of the Bayesian-fuzzy hybrid intelligent tutoring system incorporating advanced AI algorithms. The final stage involved evaluation of system performance (accuracy and timeliness) and user acceptance through Technology Acceptance Model assessment.

To develop the Math Tagumpay system, the researchers used modern web technologies optimized for Philippine educational contexts. The frontend utilizes React.js for cross-platform compatibility and responsive design, deployed via Netlify's global CDN for fast loading in resource-constrained environments. The backend combines Netlify Functions with Supabase PostgreSQL for scalable serverless architecture.

React.js was chosen for its component-based architecture, enabling creation of age-appropriate interfaces for Grade 3-4 students. The system features colorful, interactive elements with large buttons and clear typography suitable for young learners. Mathematical problems are presented within culturally relevant Philippine contexts, including local foods, transportation, and celebrations, to enhance student engagement and comprehension.

The Supabase backend provides enterprise-grade security, automated backups, and real-time data synchronization. The database schema supports user management, educational content delivery, learning state tracking, and analytics. Row Level Security policies ensure data protection while maintaining performance for concurrent classroom usage.

For the intelligent algorithms, the system implements Bayesian Knowledge Tracing using probabilistic models to track individual student learning progression. The Fuzzy Logic Engine handles uncertainty in young learners' responses by analyzing multiple factors including response time, hint usage patterns, and difficulty levels. This hybrid approach processes complex educational decisions in real-time while maintaining high accuracy rates essential for effective mathematics instruction.

## System Architecture

The Math Tagumpay Bayesian-Fuzzy Hybrid Intelligent Tutoring System implements a novel sequential processing architecture specifically designed for Grade 3-4 mathematics education in Philippine educational contexts. This architecture represents a fundamental innovation in educational AI design, employing sequential Bayesian Knowledge Tracing followed by Fuzzy Logic processing rather than traditional parallel hybrid approaches.

**Sequential Processing Innovation**: Unlike existing parallel BKT-Fuzzy hybrid systems documented in the literature (Chen et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019), Math Tagumpay implements a sequential processing approach where Bayesian Knowledge Tracing outputs serve as primary inputs to the Fuzzy Logic engine. This design enables sophisticated two-stage uncertainty refinement, allowing fuzzy logic to operate on refined knowledge parameters rather than raw student responses.

**Technical Architecture Overview**: The system utilizes React.js for cross-platform compatibility and responsive design, deployed via Netlify's global Content Delivery Network (CDN) for optimized loading performance in resource-constrained environments. The backend combines Netlify Functions with Supabase PostgreSQL for scalable serverless architecture. This configuration provides enterprise-grade security, automated backups, real-time data synchronization, and robust performance for concurrent classroom usage while maintaining cost-effectiveness for educational institutions.

**Intelligent Algorithm Implementation**: The system implements Bayesian Knowledge Tracing using probabilistic models to track individual student learning progression through four key parameters: initial knowledge probability (P(L₀)), learning rate (P(T)), guess rate (P(G)), and slip rate (P(S)). These refined knowledge parameters then serve as inputs to the Fuzzy Logic Engine. The fuzzy logic component handles uncertainty in young learners' responses by analyzing multiple contextual factors including response time patterns, hint usage behaviors, difficulty progression, and engagement indicators. This approach enables nuanced interpretation of partial understanding states characteristic of early childhood learning.

**Cultural Adaptation Framework**: The architecture incorporates comprehensive cultural adaptation elements specifically designed for Philippine educational contexts, including DepEd curriculum alignment, collaborative learning support mechanisms, and infrastructure-resilient design principles that accommodate intermittent connectivity and limited technological resources. The user interface design prioritizes cultural adaptation through incorporation of familiar Philippine scenarios including local foods, transportation systems, and cultural celebrations. Mathematical problems are presented within culturally relevant contexts to enhance student engagement and comprehension while maintaining alignment with DepEd curriculum standards.

This proposed system architecture represents a comprehensive technical solution that addresses both the sophisticated algorithmic requirements for effective educational AI and the practical implementation needs of Philippine educational contexts, providing a foundation for culturally-adapted, technologically-advanced mathematics education enhancement.

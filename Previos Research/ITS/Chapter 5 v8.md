## Summary of Findings

The study aimed to develop and evaluate a Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid Intelligent Tutoring System for Grade 3-4 mathematics in the Philippines. It used descriptive-quantitative methodology. The respondents were 10 Grade 3-4 mathematics teachers from elementary schools in Bataan Province who participated in a two-week implementation and evaluation of the Math Tagumpay system.

Based on the gathered data, the following findings were drawn:

1. **The system demonstrated exceptional performance across both accuracy and timeliness dimensions.** System accuracy achieved an overall weighted mean of 4.30 (Agree), representing a 94% positive response rate. The highest rating was for mathematical content generation and solution correctness at 4.60 (Strongly Agree). System timeliness achieved an overall weighted mean of 4.20 (Agree), representing a 94% positive response rate. Immediate feedback provision received the highest rating at 4.50 (Strongly Agree). The overall system performance achieved a weighted mean of 4.25, representing a 94% positive response rate across all performance dimensions.

2. **The system was highly acceptable across all TAM constructs with an overall weighted mean of 4.04 (Agree) representing an 85% positive response rate.** Specifically, Perceived Usefulness achieved 4.22 (Agree) with 95% positive response rate, with teaching effectiveness enhancement receiving the highest rating of 4.50 (Strongly Agree). Perceived Ease of Use achieved 3.68 (Agree), representing a 68% positive response rate. Attitude Toward Using achieved 4.26 (Agree), representing a 98% positive response rate, with general positive attitude receiving 4.40 (Agree). Behavioral Intention to Use achieved 3.98 (Agree), representing an 88% positive response rate.

3. **The comprehensive evaluation revealed that the Math Tagumpay Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid ITS achieved an overall weighted mean of 4.18 (Agree) with an 89.5% positive response rate across all evaluation dimensions.** System Accuracy (4.30) received the highest rating, followed by System Timeliness (4.20), and Technology Acceptance (4.04). Areas for improvement were identified primarily in Perceived Ease of Use, particularly in achieving desired functions easily (3.60) and developing skillful usage (3.60). This indicates a need for enhanced user training and interface optimization.

## Conclusions

Based on the findings of the study, the following conclusions were derived:

1. **The developed Bayesian-Fuzzy hybrid ITS demonstrates exceptional technical performance for third- and fourth-grade mathematics education.** The system successfully combines Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and fuzzy logic algorithms to achieve high accuracy in mathematical content generation, student knowledge assessment, and adaptive content recommendation while maintaining the real-time responsiveness essential for young learners' engagement.

2. **The system achieved strong user acceptance among third and fourth grade mathematics teachers in Philippine educational settings.** Teachers demonstrated high perceived usefulness, positive attitudes, and strong behavioral intentions to continue using the system, validating the effectiveness of culturally adapted intelligent tutoring systems in Philippine elementary mathematics education.

3. **The hybrid AI approach effectively addresses the complexity of early elementary mathematics learning.** The integration of probabilistic knowledge tracking with uncertainty handling capabilities has proven superior to single-algorithm approaches, successfully managing the partial understanding states and variable response patterns characteristic of third- and fourth-grade learners.

4. **User experience optimization remains the primary area for enhancement.** While teachers recognize substantial educational value and demonstrate positive attitudes toward the system, moderate ease-of-use scores indicate the need for improved interface design and comprehensive training programs to maximize adoption and effectiveness.

5. **The Math Tagumpay system validates the viability of advanced AI technologies in resource-constrained educational environments.** The successful implementation across diverse elementary schools in Bataan Province demonstrates that sophisticated educational AI can enhance rather than complicate third- and fourth-grade mathematics instruction when properly designed and culturally adapted.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings and conclusions, the researcher submits the following recommendations:

1. **Elementary schools should consider integrating the developed system in their Grade 3-4 mathematics curriculum.** The 94% system performance and 85% user acceptance rates provide strong evidence for institutional adoption following the implementation framework validated in this study.

2. **School administrators should establish implementation frameworks for AI-enhanced educational technologies including teacher training and technical support.** The study's identification of perceived ease of use as the primary enhancement area indicates that structured training programs can significantly improve adoption success and long-term implementation effectiveness.

3. **Teachers should use the developed system to enhance their teaching effectiveness and student monitoring capabilities which would benefit their relationships with learners and parents.** The exceptional perceived usefulness scores (4.22) demonstrate strong recognition of educational value that can improve instructional outcomes.

4. **Teachers should participate in professional development programs focused on AI integration in mathematics education.** The moderate ease-of-use scores indicate that comprehensive training addressing user interface navigation and system functionality can maximize implementation success.

5. **The Department of Education should develop national frameworks supporting intelligent tutoring system implementation in elementary mathematics education.** The study's success in achieving both technical performance and cultural acceptance provides evidence-based foundation for policy development that promotes educational technology innovation while preserving Filipino educational values.

6. **Future researchers and MSIT students could use this study as a reference.** They may propose similar studies incorporating enhanced system features and expanding to other educational levels such as primary, secondary, and tertiary education using other subject areas as instructional content. Longitudinal studies examining sustained adoption patterns and student learning outcomes would provide comprehensive evidence of long-term educational effectiveness.

7. **Parents should be trained about the use of the system and oriented on the importance of AI technology to fully realize the benefits that the system can provide.** Community engagement and stakeholder support enhance implementation effectiveness and contribute to sustainable adoption across diverse educational contexts.

8. **Technology developers should adopt the sequential Bayesian Knowledge Tracing followed by Fuzzy Logic processing architecture validated in this study.** The superior performance compared to parallel hybrid approaches provides technical guidance for advancing educational AI capabilities while maintaining real-time responsiveness requirements.

9. **Educational policy makers should establish funding mechanisms and infrastructure support programs that enable schools to implement advanced educational AI systems.** The study's demonstration that sophisticated technology can operate effectively in resource-constrained environments suggests that strategic investments can yield significant educational returns.

10. **Regional education offices should pilot the Math Tagumpay system across multiple schools to validate scalability and identify region-specific adaptation requirements.** The cultural adaptation framework provides foundation for extending implementation beyond Bataan Province while maintaining cultural sensitivity essential for sustainable adoption.

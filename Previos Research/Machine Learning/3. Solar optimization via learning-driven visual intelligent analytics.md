**Study ID/Title:** Devansh Behl et al. (2026) - "Solar optimization via learning-driven visual intelligent analytics"

**Objective/Target variable:**

- **Objective:** To develop a globally adaptable, end-to-end framework (SOLVIA) for predictive cleaning and intelligent maintenance of photovoltaic (PV) systems to optimize energy yield and minimize maintenance costs.
- **Target variable:**
    - **Primary:** AC Power Output (Continuous).
    - **Secondary:** Dust Accumulation (for forecasting soiling) and Financial Loss (for cleaning recommendations).

**Dataset:**

- **Source:** Rooftop PV installation (24.12 kW) at Netaji Subhas University of Technology (NSUT), Dwarka, Delhi, India.
- **Sample size (n):** Two-year dataset (2021–2023) collected at 15-minute intervals.
- **Features (count + key features):** 27 features total. Key features include:
    - **Environmental:** Solar irradiance (GHI, DHI, BNI), Ambient temperature, Module temperature, Wind speed/direction, Relative humidity, Rainfall, PM2.5/PM10 concentrations, NO2 concentration.
    - **Electrical:** AC/DC Power, AC/DC Voltage, AC/DC Current, Power Ratio (PR), Efficiency.
    - **Derived:** Soiling Index, Historical Power Lags.
- **Class balance (counts or %):** N/A (Regression task).

**Preprocessing:**

- **Missing values handling:**
    - **Weather/PM data:** Imputed using multivariate K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN, k=3) if <4% missing.
    - **PV Electrical data:** Forward-filled for gaps ≤2 hours; larger gaps discarded.
    - **Sensor/API Alignment:** Linear interpolation and Kalman filters used to synchronize 60-minute API data with 15-minute sensor data.
- **Encoding/scaling:**
    - Min-Max normalization.
    - Log-scaling for heavy-tail PV power distribution.
- **Feature selection (if any):** Ablation study performed to assess sensor contribution (Irradiance found most critical).
- **Imbalance handling (SMOTE/class weights/undersampling/etc.):** N/A.

**Models compared:**

- Linear Regression.
- Polynomial Regression.
- Lasso Regression.
- Decision Tree Regression.
- Gradient Boost Regression.
- Random Forest Regression (Ensemble).
- _Note: Facebook Prophet was used for temporal dust forecasting._

**Validation design:**

- **Train/test split OR k-fold (k=?):**
    - **Split:** 70% Training, 15% Validation, 15% Testing.
    - **Cross-validation:** Rolling-origin time-series split (5 folds) to preserve seasonality.
- **Any external validation?:** Economic optimization workflow was evaluated/simulated across three additional sites: NIT Srinagar (India), University of Bonn (Germany), and Deakin University (Australia).

**Metrics reported:**

- **Accuracy:** N/A
- **Precision:** N/A
- **Recall:** N/A
- **F1-score:** N/A
- **ROC-AUC:** N/A
- **PR-AUC:** N/A
- **Calibration (Brier/calibration curve):** 95% Prediction Intervals (PI) reported.
- **Best model + best values:** Random Forest Regression.
    - **RMSE:** 3.8 W.
    - **MAE:** 2.6 W.
    - **R²:** 0.95.

**Statistical test/comparison:**

- **Noise Robustness:** Tested model stability by injecting ±5% and ±10% synthetic noise into input variables.
- **Ablation Study:** Evaluated R² drop by removing feature groups (e.g., removing Irradiance dropped R² by 0.149).

**Explainability:**

- **Feature importance/SHAP/LIME/etc.:** SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) used to analyze feature contribution.
- **Top predictors:**
    - **Irradiance:** ~72–79% contribution.
    - **Temperature:** 14–18% contribution.
    - **Wind speed:** 5–8% contribution.

**Key findings (2-4 bullets):**

- **Predictive Accuracy:** The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy (R² = 0.95) in predicting PV power output, effectively capturing non-linear interactions between dust, weather, and power generation.
- **Economic Optimization:** The SOLVIA framework reduced cleaning frequency by over 30% compared to fixed-interval schedules (e.g., from 24 to 16 times/year at NSUT), resulting in significant cost savings and reduced unnecessary water usage.
- **Energy Recovery:** Optimized cleaning schedules led to a 7% increase in energy yield (approx. 2.48 MWh recovered) compared to a 5% recovery from fixed schedules.
- **Global Adaptability:** The economic framework proved robust across diverse climates (semi-arid, mountainous, temperate, coastal), consistently outperforming fixed schedules and other heuristic methods (like Soiling Index triggers) in net economic gain.

**Limitations (from paper):**

- **Sensor Dependence:** The framework relies heavily on the accuracy of environmental and electrical sensor data; sensor failure or calibration drift can impact performance.
- **Site-Specific Calibration:** Despite adaptability, initial site-specific calibration (retraining) is required to achieve high prediction accuracy.
- **Extreme Weather:** Model generalization may degrade during rapidly evolving or extreme weather conditions (e.g., dust storms) where historical patterns are poor predictors.

**Deployment/implementation notes (if any):**

- **Web Application:** A cloud-ready web application (SOLVIA) was developed using Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB to provide interactive dashboards, real-time monitoring, and automated cleaning recommendations.
- **Decision Support:** The system recommends cleaning only when projected financial losses exceed the cost of cleaning.

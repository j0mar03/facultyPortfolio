Analyzing and anticipating these dynamics are fundamental for efficient urban planning, resource management, and policy formulation. Leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques with geographic information systems (GIS) for urban growth patterns prediction. This paper examines integrating machine learning (ML) techniques with geographic information systems (GIS) for urban growth patterns prediction. Leveraging the spatial analytical strengths of GIS combined with the predictive potential of ML, we develop a framework for forecasting urban growth using historical data, socioeconomic parameters, and spatial features. We process ML methodologies such as decision trees (DTs), support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), and deep learning models for urban growth prediction. We also discuss how satellite and remote sensing data offer high-resolution spatial data collections, which are critical for accurate modeling. Positioned around the synergy between ML and GIS, this work provides a framework for addressing critical urban growth challenges and sets the stage for smarter, data-driven decision making across the fields of urban planning and policy. These findings are intended to be part of the larger conversation around the phenomena of urbanization and thus should be of interest to academics, planners, and public policy-makers operating at the nexus of technology and urbanism.","2026","2026-02-19 09:40:01","2026-02-19 10:49:15","","189-203","","","1468 LNNS","","","","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This could be improved to: “We utilize the stability criterion of a discrete dynamical system to analyze and discuss the stability of equilibrium points in the nonlinear system.” A financial management early warning model for universities was constructed based on actual situations, and the practical effect of the model was verified through experimental analysis methods.

This study assesses physician adherence to treatment protocols for urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa using machine learning algorithms. A retrospective dataset spanning January 2018 to December 2022 from a local Tripoli hospital in North Lebanon was analyzed. Non-compliance cases were classified based on factors impacting protocol adherence. The antimicrobial susceptibility test results were utilized to evaluate physicians' empirical treatment choices. Various algorithms, including Support vector machine, classifier chain, K-Neighbors classifier, Linear Regression, and Random Forest, were employed to build and train the machine learning model. The support vector machine algorithm exhibited the highest accuracy, accurately predicting antimicrobial susceptibility in 70% of cases.

This study focused on improving operations at the UiTM Kuala Terengganu Cendekiawan Library, which faced issues like limited insight into student engagement, delays in material allocation, and a lack of clear data visualization. The project aimed to predict library visit factors, classify book borrowing categories, and measure student satisfaction. Using the CRISPDM methodology, data from library traffic, book rentals, and surveys were analyzed with machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. Cross-validation was used to ensure reliable results. Naive Bayes gave the highest accuracy for predicting visit factors (77.20%) and student satisfaction (94.80%), while Random Forest performed best for borrowing categories (64.11%). Key factors influencing usage and satisfaction included study year, specific weeks in the semester, age, access type, and elements of the Theory of Reasoned Action (e.g., student attitudes and intentions). A Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize findings, and it was evaluated by three experts using the DATUS model. The dashboard was found to be user-friendly, effective, and efficient, with suggestions for minor improvements in visuals and clarity.

This paper explores the application of machine learning techniques to analyze student engagement levels in online and face-to-face learning environments to uncover actionable insights. The data about student engagement was collected comprising diverse student attributes such as class interest, attendance, effort, and technology proficiency. Firstly, the dataset underwent preprocessing to handle missing values and normalize attributes. Attributes selection using Information Gain and Correlation are employed to identify key predictors influencing student engagement. Subsequently, classification algorithms were applied to build predictive models. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Afterwards, trend analysis was carried out using a data visualization approach. The insights obtained from these analyses guide to the identification of critical factors such as class interest, attendance, and technology proficiency, which significantly impact engagement levels. The findings highlight the effectiveness of machine learning in discerning patterns and predicting student behaviors in virtual learning environments with Logistic Regression yielded 93.30% classification accuracy.

We focus on motion generation for a 3 degrees of freedom (3DOF) inflatable robot arm, which consists of soft inflatable body links and rigid joints. This research explores the limitations of relying solely on soft robot compliance for completing contact-based tasks. Our goal is to generate adaptive motion for contact-based tasks by exploiting the compliance of soft links.

| T1: Early Warning in Education | Student/university predictive and early warning applications. | 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 19, 22, 23 | Education-focused prediction is active, especially for student outcomes. | Faculty-side submission compliance prediction is still underrepresented. |

| T3: Imbalanced Data and Evaluation Metrics | Handling rare-event risk classes and robust evaluation. | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 | Many records imply risk-class prediction, but metric details are absent in metadata exports. | Full-text extraction is needed to benchmark precision/recall/F1, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC. |
| T4: Explainability and Feature Importance | Feature ranking/selection and interpretable model outputs. | 18, 23 | Explainability appears in a smaller subset of studies. | Present study should include feature importance and decision transparency for administrative adoption. |

## H. Research Gap Synthesis (Drafting Block)

### H.1 Empirical Gaps
1. Most included studies focus on student outcomes, financial risk, healthcare, or other domains rather than faculty portfolio submission compliance.
2. Existing records show predictive intent, but cross-study reporting of operational outcomes in academic administration workflows is limited.
3. Few directly evaluate institution-specific, workflow-level compliance prediction for faculty deliverables.

### H.2 Methodological Gaps
1. Metadata exports do not consistently expose validation protocols, making methodological comparability weak without full-text extraction.
2. Reporting of class imbalance handling, calibration, and threshold selection is often unclear at metadata level.
3. Unified benchmarking using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and PR-AUC is not directly available from export metadata alone.

### H.3 Contextual Gaps
1. Limited direct work targets faculty portfolio submission timeliness/completeness in web-based institutional systems.
2. Deployment details for decision support inside existing academic management platforms are sparse.
3. Explainability tailored to administrative decision-making for faculty compliance remains underdeveloped.

### H.4 Final Gap Statement for Present Study

> Existing studies demonstrate broad machine learning use for early warning and risk prediction, but direct evidence for faculty portfolio submission compliance in a web-based institutional workflow is limited. The present study addresses this by building and evaluating a quantitative predictive model focused on late or incomplete faculty portfolio submissions, emphasizing comparable metrics (including ROC-AUC and PR-AUC), and integration into an operational Faculty Portfolio Management System.

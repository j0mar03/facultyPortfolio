**Study ID/Title:** M. N. Razali et al. (2021) - "Performance Evaluation of Masked Face Recognition Using Deep Learning for Covid-19 Standard of Procedure (SOP) Compliance Monitoring"

**Objective/Target variable:**

- **Objective:** To evaluate the performance of various Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models as feature extractors combined with machine learning classifiers to create an effective masked face recognition model for autonomous monitoring of Covid-19 SOP compliance.
- **Target variable:** Face Mask Status (Binary Classification).
    - **Classes:** With Mask, Without Mask.

**Dataset:**

- **Source:** "Face Mask Dataset" (reference in paper), a collection comprising the Kaggle Medical Mask dataset and Prajna Bhandary dataset from PyImageSearch.
- **Sample size (n):** 11,042 images total.
- **Features (count + key features):** Input images (JPEG) of varying resolutions, lighting, and camera viewpoints.
    - **Extracted Features:**
        - DENSENET201: 1,920 (1-D) or (8,8,30) (2-D) features.
        - NASNETLARGE: 1,000 (1-D) or (2,2,250) (2-D) features.
        - INCEPTIONRESNETV2: 1,536 (1-D) or (16,16,6) (2-D) features.
        - EFFNET: 1,280 (1-D) or (16,16,245) (2-D) features.
- **Class balance (counts or %):** Balanced (50/50 split).
    - With Mask: 5,521 images.
    - Without Mask: 5,521 images.

**Preprocessing:**

- **Missing values handling:** NR
- **Encoding/scaling:** NR (Implied standard CNN preprocessing, e.g., resizing to 224x224, 299x299, or 331x331 depending on the model,,).
- **Feature selection (if any):** Transfer learning used. Pre-trained models (DENSENET201, NASNETLARGE, INCEPTIONRESNETV2, EFFNET) were used to extract features from images.
- **Imbalance handling (SMOTE/class weights/undersampling/etc.):** NR (Dataset is perfectly balanced).

**Models compared:**

- **Feature Extractors:** DENSENET201, NASNETLARGE, INCEPTIONRESNETV2, EFFICIENTNET (EFFNET),.
- **Classifiers:**
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM)
    - Decision Tree (DT)
    - K-nearest neighbor (KNN)
    - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    - Random Forest (RF)

**Validation design:**

- **Train/test split OR k-fold (k=?):** Train/Test split. The images were randomly divided with a **70:30 ratio**.
- **Any external validation?:** NR

**Metrics reported:**

- **Accuracy:** Yes (Formula: (TP+TN) / (TP+FP+TN+FN)).
- **Precision:** NR
- **Recall:** NR
- **F1-score:** NR
- **ROC-AUC:** NR
- **PR-AUC:** NR
- **Calibration (Brier/calibration curve):** NR
- **Best model + best values:**
    - **Accuracy:** **DENSENET201-SVM** and **EFFNET-LSVM** both achieved the highest accuracy of **0.9972**,.
    - **Efficiency:** **EFFNET-LSVM** is considered the best overall due to better computational time (feature extraction and classification) and smaller feature size,.

**Statistical test/comparison:**

- **Computation Time Analysis:** Comparison of training time (minutes) and feature extraction time (minutes) across models,.
- **Epoch Analysis:** Analyzed CNN performance at 30, 60, 90, and 120 epochs.

**Explainability:**

- **Feature importance/SHAP/LIME/etc.:** NR
- **Top predictors:** NR (Image-based deep learning features).

**Key findings (2-4 bullets):**

- **Top Performance:** Both DENSENET201-SVM and EFFNET-LSVM achieved the highest classification accuracy of 99.72% on the test set,.
- **Efficiency Winner:** EFFNET-LSVM is recommended as the superior model for deployment because its feature extraction time is more than 6 times faster than DENSENET201, and it produces a feature vector size about 30% smaller.
- **Weakest Performer:** NASNETLARGE consistently performed worse than other feature extractors, particularly when paired with KNN (Accuracy: 92.18%).
- **Training Speed:** Random Forest was the fastest classifier to train (avg. 0.0297 mins), while CNN classifiers took the longest (avg. 3.8126 mins).

**Limitations (from paper):**

- **Dataset Realism:** The paper suggests future work should "acquire the local or real dataset," implying the current collection (though containing real images) might not fully represent the specific target environment for deployment.
- **Scope:** While the introduction discusses "appropriate use" of masks (e.g., covering nose/mouth), the experiment treats the problem as a binary "with mask" vs "without mask" classification, potentially overlooking "incorrectly worn" masks in the result analysis.

**Deployment/implementation notes (if any):**

- **Objective:** The model is intended for an autonomous monitoring system to replace manual checking in large public crowds (supermarkets, malls, schools),.
- **Recommendation:** EFFNET-LSVM is highlighted as the best candidate for real-world applications due to its balance of high accuracy and low computational resource requirements.

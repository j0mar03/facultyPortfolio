|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1: Early Warning in Education | Student/university prediction and warning studies. | 2, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 24 | Strong student-focused evidence base exists. | Limited direct focus on faculty portfolio submission compliance. |
| T2: ML Algorithms for Risk Classification | Use of tree-based, linear, kernel, and ensemble methods. | 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25 | Model comparison is common, especially RF/SVM/XGBoost in abstracts. | Need one standardized model comparison on faculty-portfolio data. |
| T3: Imbalanced Data and Evaluation Metrics | Evaluation of rare-risk events and threshold trade-offs. | 3, 5, 25 | Some studies report ROC-AUC and class-balance handling. | Consistent PR-AUC and calibration reporting remains limited. |

## H. Research Gap Synthesis (Drafting Block)

### H.1 Empirical Gaps
1. Most evidence centers on student outcomes, financial risk, or non-education domains rather than faculty portfolio submission compliance.
2. Cross-study operational evidence for faculty-focused submission workflows is still sparse.
3. Multi-institution and faculty-specific compliance datasets are rarely reported.

### H.2 Methodological Gaps
1. Not all studies report class imbalance handling and threshold policy in enough detail.
2. Calibration reporting is limited compared to discrimination metrics.
3. PR-AUC reporting is inconsistent, even when problems are likely imbalanced.

### H.3 Contextual Gaps
1. Few studies integrate predictive models directly into a web-based faculty portfolio management workflow.
2. Administrative explainability requirements are not consistently addressed.
3. Institution-specific policy and process constraints are underrepresented in current models.

### H.4 Final Gap Statement for Present Study

> Current literature supports machine learning-based early warning across several domains, yet direct, deployment-oriented prediction of late or incomplete faculty portfolio submissions remains limited. This study addresses that gap through a quantitative predictive model integrated into a web-based Faculty Portfolio Management System, with emphasis on comparable metrics including ROC-AUC and PR-AUC.

## J. Writing Map for Chapter II

1. Global-to-local evolution of predictive early warning in higher education and compliance-related settings
2. Algorithmic patterns in prior studies (tree-based, kernel-based, linear, and ensemble approaches)
3. Metric standards and reporting quality (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, calibration)
4. Model comparison and validation designs in prior research
5. Explainability and deployment implications for academic administrators
6. Final synthesis of gaps leading to this faculty portfolio early warning study

### Next Data-Completion Step
- For `Abstract-only` and `Metadata-only` studies, continue filling missing dataset, validation, calibration, and limitation details when additional full text becomes available.

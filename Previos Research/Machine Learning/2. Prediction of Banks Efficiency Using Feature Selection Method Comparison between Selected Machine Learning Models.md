**Study ID/Title:** Hamzeh F. Assous (2022) - "Prediction of Banks Efficiency Using Feature Selection Method: Comparison between Selected Machine Learning Models"

**Objective/Target variable:**

- **Objective:** To examine the determinants of efficiency for conventional and Islamic Saudi banks and select the best machine learning model to predict this efficiency.
- **Target variable:** Cost Efficiency Ratio (Continuous). Calculated as Other Operating Expenses divided by Net Revenue.

**Dataset:**

- **Source:** Annual financial reports of Saudi banks.
- **Sample size (n):** 11 banks (7 conventional, 4 Islamic) observed over 5 years (2014–2018). (Total observations approx. 55).
- **Features (count + key features):** 17 attributes initially. Key categories include:
    - **Profitability:** ROA, ROE, Net Interest Income (NII)/Total Assets (TA), EPS.
    - **Management Practices:** Business per employee, Net profit per employee.
    - **Assets:** Loan Loss reserves, Book value per share.
    - **Capital:** Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) Total, CAR Tier 1.
    - **Liquidity:** Total Loans/Total Deposits (LTD), Total Deposits.
- **Class balance (counts or %):** N/A (Regression task).

**Preprocessing:**

- **Missing values handling:** NR
- **Encoding/scaling:** NR
- **Feature selection (if any):** A feature selection method was applied to specify key variables for the prediction models. For example, for the CHAID model, it selected Bank name, CAR total, and CAR tier 1.
- **Imbalance handling:** N/A (Regression task).

**Models compared:**

- Linear Regression (Stepwise).
- Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID).
- Neural Network (NN).
- _Note:_ Models were compared both with and without feature selection.

**Validation design:**

- **Train/test split OR k-fold (k=?):** The data was split into a "training phase" and a "testing phase". (Specific split ratio NR, though Figure 4 suggests a split).
- **Any external validation?:** NR

**Metrics reported:**

- **Accuracy:** NR (Regression task).
- **Precision:** NR
- **Recall:** NR
- **F1-score:** NR
- **ROC-AUC:** NR
- **PR-AUC:** NR
- **Calibration (Brier/calibration curve):** NR
- **Best model + best values:**
    - **Training Phase:** Neural Network (NN) with feature selection (R² = 0.987, RMSE = 1.112).
    - **Testing Phase:** CHAID with feature selection (R² = 0.985, RMSE = 1.467). The author concludes CHAID is the best fit overall for deployment.

**Statistical test/comparison:**

- **Stepwise Regression:** Used to determine the statistically significant drivers of efficiency for conventional and Islamic banks separately.
- **Model Comparison:** Compared using R², MSE, MAE, MBE, and RMSE.

**Explainability:**

- **Feature importance:** Feature selection identified Capital Ratios (CAR Total and CAR Tier 1) as the best predictors for the CHAID model.
- **Top predictors (Determinants via Regression):**
    - **Conventional Banks:** ROA (Profitability), Total Deposits (Liquidity), Business per employee (Management).
    - **Islamic Banks:** NII/TA & EPS (Profitability), Total Deposits (Liquidity), Business per employee (Management).

**Key findings (2-4 bullets):**

- **Determinants of Efficiency:** Efficiency in Saudi banks is significantly driven by profitability, liquidity, and managerial practices. Specifically, higher profitability (ROA) improves efficiency (reduces cost ratio) in conventional banks, while higher liquidity (Total Deposits) was associated with higher costs (lower efficiency) across both types.
- **Best Prediction Model:** The CHAID model (using feature selection) outperformed SVM, NN, and Linear Regression in the testing phase, achieving the highest R² (0.985) and lowest RMSE (1.467).
- **Key Predictors:** When using feature selection for the best performing model (CHAID), the most critical predictors for cost efficiency were capital ratios: CAR Total and CAR Tier 1.

**Limitations (from paper):**

- The study focused only on cost efficiency, excluding other types like technical or allocative efficiency.
- Data was limited to secondary financial reports; qualitative data (interviews) was not considered.
- The sample was limited to Saudi banks within the GCC region.

**Deployment/implementation notes (if any):**

- **Early Warning System:** Policymakers can use the CHAID model as an early warning system to predict financial distress scenarios.
- **Investment Strategy:** Stockholders can utilize the findings to identify and invest in banks with better cost-efficiency ratios.

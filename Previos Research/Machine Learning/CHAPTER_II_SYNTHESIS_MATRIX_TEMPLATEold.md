### H.4 Final Gap Statement for Present Study

Draft paragraph:

> Existing studies demonstrate strong machine learning performance for educational risk prediction, but limited work addresses faculty portfolio submission compliance using institution-specific workflow data, calibrated probability outputs, and deployment-ready integration into web-based academic management systems. This study addresses these gaps by developing and evaluating a quantitative predictive early warning model for late or incomplete faculty portfolio submissions and integrating the model into an operational Faculty Portfolio Management System.
